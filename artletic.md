I was tasked with presenting designs that I felt did design well, and one who didn't. I decided to write about them.

## Design Done Right: Dropbox

### Why is it successful?
Dropbox does a lot of things right. I think the biggest of which is the simplicty and seamlessness of their design. Dropbox understands incredibly well that design is so much more than how something looks. It's about how it works. Their design is great because not only do millions of people use their web app, Mac app, and mobile apps, it's easy for these people to use them. Cloud services are difficult to do. I'm sure millions rely on Dropbox to sync their files everyday, and I've never had a problem.

### What could they improve on?
This is a difficult one. Most days, I don't even remember that I have Dropbox working which is the point. I think they could do some interesting things with photos. I use Dropbox to back up all the photos I take with my devices and I wish they had a way for me to display my photos in a nice way, share them and allow people to comment on them. However, I also understand why they don't do this. It might be too big of a deviation from their core product. 


##  Design that isn't as Successful: Simplecast FM

### What isn't working?
Their backend I think needs a lot of improvement. It's my opinion that although there are some great features here, it's not built from a podcasters mentality. It's built trying to solve someone else's problem. When designing a product, it's imperative to really get into the mind of the user and see roadblocks. The interface is clunky, doesn't easily allow me to collect links for my new episodes, and doesn't allow me to shine more of a spotlight for hosts. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot being done right here, embeddable player is cool, and the podcast transfer is very useful.


### What could they improve on?
I'd like to see it be easier to create a network of shows and an API for those who only want to host their audio there, yet create their own site.
