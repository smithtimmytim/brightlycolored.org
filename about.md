*Brightly Colored* is designed and developed by me, [Tim Smith](http://ttimsmith.com), in beautiful [St. Paul, Minnesota](https://www.stpaul.gov/). This publication covers a whole range of things including, but not limited to: design, development, technology, Geek culture, and Apple.

## Why "Brightly Colored"?

The old name of this site—*The Bold Report*— just felt too official for the purpose. The name *Brightly Colored* matches my personality so much better. You'll normally find me wearing bright and vibrant things like yellow shorts, bright-patterned socks, and red shoes.

## About Tim

{% figure small__right /uploads/2013/09/tim_680x510.jpg %}

Writing about yourself is tough, but here we go.

I live in Saint Paul, MN with my beautiful and amazing wife, Kelly. We have two cats: Izzy and Minnie. I can be very opinionated and picky about certain things, but kindness is very important to me. I strive to lace kindness and empathy into everything I do.

I've messed up a lot in life, but as Yoda once said, "The greatest teacher, failure is." Some of the failure has been painful—both to me and others. I've always tried to take responsibility for it and learn.

I started my adventure into design and development in 2006 when I was fifteen. I took some community college classes, but I'm mostly self-taught. My early career was really hard—no one took me seriously as soon as I told them how old I was.

Since then, I've had the chance to work with some pretty amazing people. Some of those amazing people work for companies like [Relay FM](https://www.relay.fm/), [Carbon Ads](https://carbonads.net/), [&Yet](https://andyet.com/), [Lullabot](https://www.lullabot.com/), [Crush & Lovely](http://crushlovely.com/), and The Clinton Foundation.

I originally started this site thinking I'd be the next [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber), but quickly realized I didn't actually want that (not to mention, I'm not nearly as great a writer). Ever since, this wonderful place is where I write about all that interests me.

## How It's Made

Most writing is done on my Macbook Pro in [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer). I also write and publish from iOS in [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/). If you'd like to learn how I do that, [I wrote about it](/2016/01/publishing-to-jekyll-from-ios/). The site is designed and developed in ~~[Atom](https://atom.io/)~~ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), with the exception of the logo. That was done in Adobe Illustrator. I won't link to that one because if you've never heard of it, you've probably lived a better life. It's all hosted by ~~[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)~~ [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). If you're wondering how to do that, [I wrote about moving to Netlify](/2017/04/moving-to-netlify/).

A huge thanks to the friends who've contributed to this site: [TJ Draper](/authors/tjdraper) and [Keaton Taylor](/authors/keatontaylor). Also thanks to [Sonya Mann](https://twitter.com/sonyaellenmann) for editing a few articles here and there, making me sound much better. Of course, a huge thank you to my partner in crime, Kelly Smith who listens to ideas and helps proofread from time to time.
