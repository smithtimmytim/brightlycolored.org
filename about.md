*The Bold Report* is designed, developed, and written by [Tim Smith](http://ttimsmith.com) in beautiful, and sometimes cold, St. Paul, Minnesota. I *don't* currently write this site full-time.

## Purpose
I write about design, development, technology, Geek culture, Apple, and more. My purpose *is not* to inform you of breaking news, rather to give perspective and insight into these topics. The coverage of news is biased by personal interest, and doesn't attempt to follow any type of model which some might believe to constitute a "tech blog".

I endeavor to be well-balanced when reporting any type of news, however I am very passionate and opinionated on these topics, and that will always have an influence on what I write.

## Tools
Most writing is done on my Macbook Pro in [Byword](http://bywordapp.com/). The site is designed and developed in [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), with the exception of the logo. Hosted by [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), and powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

## About me

I'm a user interface and web designer based in beautiful, but sometimes freezing, St. Paul, Minnesota. I host [*For The Record*](http://towermedia.org/ftr), a podcast about people, life, and the experiences that make us who we are.

I self-identify as a nerd who loves Star Wars and comic books, and a recovering coffee addict. When I'm not at my computer, I'm binge-watching shows, going to the movies, having brunch, or doing other old-married-couple things with my amazing wife, Kelly.
