*Brightly Colored* is designed and developed by me, [Tim Smith](http://ttimsmith.com), in beautiful [St. Paul, Minnesota](https://www.stpaul.gov/). This publication covers a whole range of things including, but not limited to: design, development, technology, Geek culture, and Apple.

## Why "Brightly Colored"?

I felt name *Brightly Colored* matched my personality. You'll normally find me wearing bright and vibrant things like yellow shorts, bright-patterned socks, and red shoes.

## About Tim

Writing about yourself is tough, but here we go.

I live in Saint Paul, MN with my beautiful and amazing wife, Kelly. We have two cats: Izzy and Minnie. I can be very opinionated and picky about certain things, but kindness is very important to me. I strive to lace kindness and empathy into everything I do.

I've messed up a lot in life, but as Yoda once said, "The greatest teacher, failure is." Some of the failure has been painful—both to me and others. I've always tried to take responsibility for it and learn.

I started my adventure into design and development in 2006 when I was fifteen. I took some community college classes, but I'm mostly self-taught. My early career was really hard—no one took me seriously as soon as I told them how old I was.

Since then, I've had the chance to work with some pretty amazing people. Some of those amazing people work for companies like [Relay FM](https://www.relay.fm/), [Carbon Ads](https://carbonads.net/), [&Yet](https://andyet.com/), [Lullabot](https://www.lullabot.com/), [Crush & Lovely](http://crushlovely.com/), and The Clinton Foundation.

I originally started this site thinking I'd be the next [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber), but quickly realized I didn't actually want that (not to mention, I'm not nearly as great a writer). Ever since, this wonderful place is where I write about all that interests me.
