*The Bold Report* is designed, developed, and written by [Tim Smith](http://ttimsmith.com) in beautiful, and sometimes cold, St. Paul, Minnesota. I *don't* currently write this site full-time.

## Purpose

I write about design, development, technology, Geek culture, Apple, and more. My purpose *is not* to inform you of breaking news, rather to give perspective and insight into these topics. The coverage of news is biased by personal interest, and doesn't attempt to follow any type of model which some might believe to consitute a "tech blog".

I endevour to be well-balanced when reporting any type of news, however I am very passionate and opinionated on these topics, and that will always have an influence on what I write.

## Tools

Most writing is done on my Macbook Pro in [Byword](http://bywordapp.com/). The site is designed and developed in [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), with the exception of the logo. Hosted by [Media Temple](http://mediatemple.net/), and powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
