    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed in the past couple of weeks, I’ve taken the responsibility of writing on this site a bit more seriously. If you haven’t noticed, that’s ok, I’m telling you now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/08/moving-over-to-jekyll/&quot;&gt;moving over to Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, the ability to write and publish quickly has given me fewer excuses not to write. I know that whether people read or not, it’s important to maintain some type of documentation of life and work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, I’ve stressed about writing things that would be “interesting”; judging at every turn whether people would like what I had to say. More recently, I’ve been persuading myself not to care. I write and share my opinion on things that interest me, and call it a day. To my surprise, there are those who appreciate that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also interested in becoming a better writer, and after doing research, I found that as with most things, the best way is to practice. I look up to writers like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marco.org/&quot;&gt;Marco Arment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://shawnblanc.net/&quot;&gt;Shawn Blanc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sarawb.com/&quot;&gt;Sara Wachter-Boettcher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avclark.com/&quot;&gt;Adam Clark&lt;/a&gt;, and draw inspiration from how they write. What I love especially about Sara and Adam is the level of honesty they’re able to communicate with their writing. I admire that vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s to a new beginning with this site. I hope you’ll be part of it. You can now subscribe to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttimsmith.com/feed.xml&quot;&gt;master feed&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttimsmith.com/feed.article.xml&quot;&gt;articles-only feed&lt;/a&gt;. All of the posts are shared on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ttimsmith_com&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://alpha.app.net/ttimsmith_com&quot;&gt;App.net&lt;/a&gt;, and if you prefer email, &lt;a href=&quot;/newsletter&quot;&gt;there’s an option for that&lt;/a&gt; too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#115;&amp;#109;&amp;#105;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#064;&amp;#116;&amp;#116;&amp;#105;&amp;#109;&amp;#115;&amp;#109;&amp;#105;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&quot;&gt;say hello&lt;/a&gt;. I love hearing from you guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—Tim&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had an absolute blast in Charlotte for Blend Conf, and I really hope I can make it next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, I just want to extend a thank you to Bermon Painter for putting on this amazing event. The fact he did it mostly by himself is admirable, and was a complete hit in its first year. Bermon was so kind to take a chance on me, and I’m so grateful, and honored to have spoken at the first Blend Conf. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about conferences is that when you hear about them, often times you hear about the speakers, the venue, the city, friends that are going, etc. Those are all great. However, the beauty lies in the things you have no idea about. The people you meet, the friends you make, and the conversations you have. For me, Blend Conference was definitely all of this. I’ve made great new friends, and I’m following new people who are just so insanely smart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two talks that really stood out for me were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.garthdb.com/&quot;&gt;Garth’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://wrenlanier.com/&quot;&gt;Wren’s&lt;/a&gt;. Garth talked about how designers can open source, and he’s in fact &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensourcedesign.is/&quot;&gt;created a site to begin this movement&lt;/a&gt;. I realized during that talk that developers are more and more comfortable with sharing how things are accomplished, and putting tons of their source code on GitHub. At this point, it seemed so normal, I’d forgotten that designers don’t really do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re very protective of our designs and don’t like to reveal how the “sausage is made” per se. This happens for various reasons, but the biggest one is often thinking a particular solution is specific to a project. The artistic side of us loves to believe that our thoughts aren’t somehow reusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wren also gave a great talk about designing on the z-axis. It blew my mind. That’s really all I can say. The way she explained the future of design got me really excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll see both of these people on The East Wing soon, so stay tuned for that. If you weren’t able to make it to Blend Conf this year, I definitely recommend it. The atmosphere is just so nice, and Charlotte is a beautiful city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you next year!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Acquiring Nokia is an Important Move</title>
    <published>2013-09-03T11:31:51-05:00</published>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s Nokia acquisition is more important than you think. It’s being brushed off by many in the media, and definitely by a lot of Apple fans; we love to ridicule this type of news. &lt;a href=&quot;http://gigaom.com/2013/09/03/why-i-think-the-7-2-billion-microsoft-nokia-deal-is-a-terrible-idea/&quot;&gt;Some just downright think it’s a terrible idea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing is definitely true, the move is late. This acquisition would’ve interested a lot more people a couple of years ago. The mobile market is very competitive, Apple and Google have years of experience, and it seems Amazon wants a piece of the pie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Nokia may be a joke in terms of market share&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but them joining forces is important news. The fact that hardware and software are now being done semi-in-house is a big deal, and indicative of some type of vision which could be successful&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Microsoft has noticed something very important, and I talked about this when I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/08/why-scott-forstall-should-be-microsofts-next-ceo/&quot;&gt;Scott Forstall becoming CEO&lt;/a&gt;—being responsible for the complete experience is the key to making products people want to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its inception, the company has allowed others to create the hardware for their software&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. They’ve given up control of the experience, and I feel it’s one of the biggest reasons they aren’t the company they want to be. Nokia becoming part of Microsoft begins to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft doesn’t want to be &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; a software company.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Steve Ballmer’s letter to employees, he said, “We are committed to working with partners, helping them build great products and great businesses on our platform, and we believe this deal will increase our partner value proposition over time.” I predict that in 4 years, Microsoft will be exclusively making Windows Phone. It’ll be theirs; software and hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that makes Apple so successful is the way they control the ecosystem. Lots of power users are turned away by how little control they have, but to the normal consumer, the careful curation of an ecosystem, makes the experience more enjoyable. It’s also important to note, that companies that don’t exercise this type of control &lt;a href=&quot;http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/28/u-s-government-issues-warning-about-security-on-android-phones/&quot;&gt;have lots of security problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next year and a half will tell whether Microsoft will take this opportunity, and execute well on it. They need a new phone, running a better operating system. If Microsoft is at all successful in the next 5 years, it will be in part because of this move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/3/4688962/with-nokia-microsoft-wants-to-triple-windows-phone-marketshare-by-2018&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft’s marketshare is just over 4% in the smartphone market. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I think the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nokia.com/us-en/phones/phone/lumia1020/&quot;&gt;Nokia Lumia&lt;/a&gt; is a great example of some great hardware decisions. It’s a pretty good-looking phone, and has a 41 megapixel camera which is perfect for what people want to do with their phone: take pictures of themselves and food. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is the reason you spend hours uninstalling software from a PC you just bought. Android has this same problem by allowing carriers to make different versions of it. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

    <title>Keyboard Maestro Macros: Sharing Links</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using Keyboard Maestro for about two weeks, and I’ve enjoyed how much time it’s starting to save me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two new Keyboard Maestro Macros I’ve made are for sharing links. I often come across things on the web that I want to share and I have to copy the title, switch to Tweetbot, paste the tile, switch back to Chrome, copy the URL, switch back to Tweetbot, and paste the URL. This get’s irritating, so I created a Macro two copy these two values and put them on my clipboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2013/09/macro-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tweet Sharing Macro&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe Safari has built in sharing, but that still sucks because you have to click. This uses a keyboard shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I do often is copy links for show notes. For most podcasters, show notes are the worst part of doing the show. It’s difficult to get the link quick and save it somewhere. I personally envy the hosts on 5by5 that have a bookmarklet. However, I’ve solved this problem quite easily for me with another macro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2013/09/macro-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Markdown Sharing Link&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So easy! I press &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+Opt+M&lt;/code&gt; and the link is in my clipboard formatted as Markdown. The time this saves me! I used to use a Chrome Extension, but again, I try to use the mouse as little as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope these can save you some time. If you’ve never used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/&quot;&gt;Keyboard Maestro&lt;/a&gt;, I recommend you look into it. Keyboard shortcuts FTW!&lt;/p&gt;
