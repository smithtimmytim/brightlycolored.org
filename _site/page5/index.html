  <p>One of the many beauties of working with Sass is how easy it is to get organized. In the past, importing different CSS files wasn’t good practice and in fact made for more HTTP requests. With Sass, you can have many different partials which allow you to isolate styles in a logical way.</p>

<p>Even as a huge Laker fan, I don’t see the logic behind this decision. Kobe Bryant has been one of the best players of the current era, but I certainly thought this would be his last year. As great as he is, age eventually catches up with you. </p>

<p>We published a great excerpt from Dan’s new book <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/sass-for-web-designers"><em>Sass for Web Designers</em></a>.

<p><a href="http://www.executionists.com/blog/website-design/cost-to-build-websites-2013/">According to recent research</a>, the average small business owner can expect to pay somewhere between $100 and $200 for stock images for their website. Of course, for the owner going through a professional designer, this is just part of a larger number. If you’re a designer, you should always be looking for ways to bring down the final cost of a website. Outbidding the competition isn’t the only factor when it comes to success, but cutting costs where possible certainly won’t hurt. </p>

<p>If you’ve been looking for a way to bring down your stock image costs and increase your bottom line, a new website may be able to help. It’s called Lootback.com, and it functions as a stock image search engine. The site partners with some of the biggest names in the stock photo industry, including iStock, ShutterStock, Graphicriver, Themeforest, and more. The premise is simple: they get a commission on every photo you buy through their site and then split that commission with you. </p>

<p><a href="http://syndicateads.net/s/uj">Lootback</a> provides users with a compilation image search engine. You type in whichever keywords fit your needs and it will come back with results from their industry partners. Helpfully, once you’ve created an account, Lootback will tell you right away how much you will save on a particular image once you’ve clicked on it. Rebates are paid into your account within 12 hours. That said, Lootback only pays out 4 times a year, so don’t expect cash back right away. Still, if you’re a designer who buys hundreds of images a year, the savings could prove substantial.</p>

<p>There are a lot of websites out there that promise to save the average shopper some money, but very few are dedicated to helping out web designers. Lootback aims to save designers time and money and they do a pretty good job of it. If you’ve been in search of a way to bring down your costs, <a href="http://syndicateads.net/s/uj">Lootback</a> is a good place to start.</p>

          <p>Vlad Savov reporting for <em>The Verge</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today was always going to be a momentous day for BlackBerry, with a looming deadline for its proposed takeover deal with Fairfax Financial Holdings. As it turns out, the full takeover isn’t taking place, but the company is going to receive an investment of $1 billion from Fairfax and a group of other institutional investors as it seeks to steer a new course.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What? I mean, it’s tough to feel bad for a company that just received a billion dollars, but what are they doing? BlackBerry is holding on for dear life, and I have to wonder whether this can turn things around for them. I hope for the best.</p>

          <p>Reported on <em>The Next Web</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Twitter is strong in Japan (as <a href="http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2011/02/02/why-twitter-outguns-facebook-in-japan/">we noted back in 2011</a>) where it’s used by one-third of the Internet population — but the country accounts for under 10 percent of its global revenue and one ad exec told WSJ that many Japanese brands “don’t think Twitter is something to pay money for.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This particular post is interesting to me. Twitter is facing challenges <em>everywhere</em>. Why is it news that advertisers don’t want to pay in these specific places?</p>

<p>With that said, I really do admire these new ways of generating revenue that they’re trying. Partnering with TV, although I originally didn’t understand it, makes a lot of sense, and is one alternative to the advertising route that so many seem to just default to.</p>

  <p>Things have gotten out of hand. Tech writers are given far too much freedom to perpetuate inaccuracies and falsehoods, as well as a generous helping of incompetence these days. That’s why it’s time to put a bit of structure in place for those publications that don’t understand good work from bad work.</p>

<p>This is an interesting read. Although <em>The Bold Report</em> isn’t incredibly popular yet, I’ve always tried to hold myself to the rules of proper journalism. I <strong><em>do not</em></strong> want to contribute to the assumption that online writers are an unprofessional bunch.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Wow. 2.9 million was already a huge number, but now thirty-eight million? I’m keeping a close watch on my card to see if it’s being used, and I’d recommend you do the same. Also, if you were using the same password in multiple places, it might be a good time to look into 1Password. At this point, the probability of your information <em>not</em> being involved in this attack is low.</p>
