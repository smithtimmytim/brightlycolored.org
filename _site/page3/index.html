<blockquote>
  <p>Today was always going to be a momentous day for BlackBerry, with a looming deadline for its proposed takeover deal with Fairfax Financial Holdings. As it turns out, the full takeover isn’t taking place, but the company is going to receive an investment of $1 billion from Fairfax and a group of other institutional investors as it seeks to steer a new course.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What? I mean, it’s tough to feel bad for a company that just received a billion dollars, but what are they doing? BlackBerry is holding on for dear life, and I have to wonder whether this can turn things around for them. I hope for the best.</p>

  <p>Twitter is strong in Japan (as <a href="http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2011/02/02/why-twitter-outguns-facebook-in-japan/">we noted back in 2011</a>) where it’s used by one-third of the Internet population — but the country accounts for under 10 percent of its global revenue and one ad exec told WSJ that many Japanese brands “don’t think Twitter is something to pay money for.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This particular post is interesting to me. Twitter is facing challenges <em>everywhere</em>. Why is it news that advertisers don’t want to pay in these specific places?</p>

<p>With that said, I really do admire these new ways of generating revenue that they’re trying. Partnering with TV, although I originally didn’t understand it, makes a lot of sense, and is one alternative to the advertising route that so many seem to just default to.</p>

  <p>Things have gotten out of hand. Tech writers are given far too much freedom to perpetuate inaccuracies and falsehoods, as well as a generous helping of incompetence these days. That’s why it’s time to put a bit of structure in place for those publications that don’t understand good work from bad work.</p>

<p>This is an interesting read. Although <em>The Bold Report</em> isn’t incredibly popular yet, I’ve always tried to hold myself to the rules of proper journalism. I <strong><em>do not</em></strong> want to contribute to the assumption that online writers are an unprofessional bunch.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Wow. 2.9 million was already a huge number, but now thirty-eight million? I’m keeping a close watch on my card to see if it’s being used, and I’d recommend you do the same. Also, if you were using the same password in multiple places, it might be a good time to look into 1Password. At this point, the probability of your information <em>not</em> being involved in this attack is low.</p>

<p>I couldn’t agree more. Although this product might have been created with great intentions, I can easily see it being abused. If people work for you, ask them to update you. Don’t spy on them, even if under the guise of “avoiding shoulder taps.”</p>

  <p>Something felt a bit off about this week’s Apple event.</p>

  <p>Part of it was the lack of surprises, which isn’t Apple’s fault. All of the product upgrades, while nice, were incremental and predictable. None of the pricing was a surprise. In fact, the only unexpected product announcement is the zombie iPad 2 sticking around for another year, shamelessly at the same price as last year.</p>

        <p>While I admire all the hard work that went in creating this new version of Tweetbot, I can’t help be a little disappointed. The app has lost much of its personality; both visually and sonically. The new app has some very well done animations, but unfortunately looks too “default iOS 7” for my taste. </p>

<p>However, I did purchase because I respect the work of Tapbots very much and I want to support them. They have the reputation of making incredible things, and I look forward to seeing the betterment of Tweetbot.</p>

        <p>Rachel Andrew writing on <em>A List Apart</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Almost every conference’s second day opens with attendees being asked how their hangovers are. Second day early-slot speakers joke that no one will turn up anyway, or they’ll all just be staring into their coffee. It has become normal, in fact expected, that drinking and staying out late is what we do while at conferences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Rachel brings up a very real issue with our conferences and events. Because our industry is very friendly, and social, it seems we might be blurring the lines of professional time and social time, a bit too much. She goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re also underlining that our events are for over-18s, maybe even over-21s, by holding them in licensed premises. Most of us know students or even those who are working professionally in our field long before they are “adult.” Should they be excluded?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy having drinks—and the article isn’t advocating for the banishment of alcohol—but I remember being the seventeen year-old kid that couldn’t drink. I’ve always been very extroverted, so it never stopped me from talking to people. However, I can see how it could affect others; making them feel excluded and not part of the group, and Rachel’s article does a great job of shining light on that fact.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After being caught paying for false praise and negative comments about competitors, Samsung has been fined just over $340,000. The issue first arose internationally in April, when Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission (FTC) announced it was opening an investigation into the allegations. That investigation found the allegations were true: the FTC says Samsung used a “large number of hired writers and designated employees” to post in Taiwanese forums.</p>

  <p>While Samsung is by no means the first company to engage in astroturfing, it’s been caught in the act twice this year alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only are they engaging in unethical marketing practices—which hilariously enough has an official term—they’ve been caught doing it <em>twice</em> in the same year.</p>

<p>Get your stuff together, Samsung. You’re better than this.</p>

        <p>Frank Shaw on <em>The Official Microsoft Blog</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Surface and Surface 2 both include Office, the world’s most popular, most powerful productivity software for free and are priced below both the iPad 2 and iPad Air respectively. Making Apple’s decision to build the price of their less popular and less powerful iWork into their tablets not a very big (or very good) deal.</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>I think they, like others, are waking up to the fact that we’ve built a better solution for people everywhere, who are getting things done from anywhere, and who don’t have hard lines between their personal and professional lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Microsoft looks incredibly stupid for publishing this garbage.</p>

<p>Who cares that you made a device you think “is the most productive tablet you can buy today,” when it’s not selling? Eighty-one percent of tablet usage is on the iPad, and I highly doubt that the Surface has a significant share of the remaining nineteen percent.</p>

<p>Microsoft has so much untapped potential they could use for making great new products. Instead, they waste their time writing a post like this that claims they understand “how people work better than anyone else.” Talk is cheap, but the fact is this: while Microsoft was busy loosing $900 million on Surface tablets in Q3 2013, Apple sold 14.6 million iPads.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, the two most common mobile devices the site is viewed on, are iOS devices. Coming in first place: iPhone with sixty-two percent. </p>

<p>Chrome was the popular browser, responsible for fifty-six percent of traffic. Nine people visited from Internet Explorer.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Most visitors are using a Mac, but twelve percent is on Windows.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

        <p>Stephen Hackett on <em>512 Pixels</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bones haven’t changed all that much over the last 13 years, but every time Apple updates OS X, it continues to improve and refine features and the underlying technologies that make them possible.</p>

  <p>…I firmly believe that OS X is the best consumer desktop operating system on the planet. It has undergone some major changes over the years, but it’s the same OS under the hood. OS X is still as stable, powerful and resilient to viruses and other malware as it has always been.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stephen is one of my favorite writers, and he’s published an amazing, in-depth review of the latest OS X. </p>

        <p>Apple Event Days are always exciting for me, and this one will be no different.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/october-2013/">watch the event live</a> on your iOS device, Mac, or Apple TV. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> During the event, I’ll be in the <em>#ssktn</em> iRC chatroom, as a kind of virtual-viewing party. </p>

<p>After the event, Chris Enns, Kyle Roderick, and myself will be talking about the event and new gadgets on the <a href="http://www.ssktn.com/live/">SSKTN live stream</a>.</p>

<p>Happy Apple Event Day!</p>

      <p>I’m so glad they’ve started to stream most of these events on the Apple TV. It seems that the only one they’re not streaming live these days is WWDC, which is totally understandable. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
