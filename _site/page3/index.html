        <p>Apple Event Days are always exciting for me, and this one will be no different.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/october-2013/">watch the event live</a> on your iOS device, Mac, or Apple TV. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> During the event, I’ll be in the <em>#ssktn</em> iRC chatroom, as a kind of virtual-viewing party. </p>

<p>After the event, Chris Enns, Kyle Roderick, and myself will be talking about the event and new gadgets on the <a href="http://www.ssktn.com/live/">SSKTN live stream</a>.</p>

<p>Happy Apple Event Day!</p>

      <p>I’m so glad they’ve started to stream most of these events on the Apple TV. It seems that the only one they’re not streaming live these days is WWDC, which is totally understandable. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

        <blockquote>
  <p>What Quarkslab’s research proves […] is that Apple’s iMessage back-end <em>could</em> be designed to allow for Apple to intercept and read message content, and there is no way we, as iMessage users, would be able to detect it.</p>

  <p>What Apple has said, and reiterated today, is that iMessage’s back-end is not in fact designed in that way — that there is no mechanism in the system for Apple employees to surreptitiously change the encryption key to allow for messages to be decrypted during transit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t have much to add to this one, I just found the article to be interesting. I agree with Gruber that it would be a <em>huge</em> mistake for Apple to lie about something as sensitive as this. <strong>However</strong>, at the end of the day, which side does it make more sense for companies to side with? Users? That’s naive.</p>

        <p>Amar Toor reporting for <em>The Verge</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to analysis from Needham &amp; Co., it’s likely that Netflix’s paid US subscriber base reached 30 million by the end of September. That may be enough to overtake HBO, which has an estimated 28.7 million subscribers in the US…</p>

  <p>In its fiscal <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/22/4545446/netflix-q2-2013-earnings">Q2 earnings report</a> this year, Netflix said it had more than 29 million US subscribers and expected to add between 230,000 and 880,000 in Q3.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Netflix is one of those companies that I love to root for. However, as <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/21/4861624/netflix-has-likely-overtaken-hbo-in-paid-us-subscribers-analysts-say#192210067">someone in the comments for this article pointed out</a>, the fact that Netflix has more subscribers than HBO, doesn’t mean they’re making more money. Still, these numbers might just give HBO the scare they need, to consider an online subscription that isn’t tied to any cable company. With Time Warner Cable being the parent company of HBO, I see this as a small probability, but there’s no way they don’t see the potential business they’re missing out on.</p>

<p>One thing is for sure, the competition between these two channels will be interesting to watch. </p>

        <h1><a href="/2013/10/freelancing-and-saying-no">Freelancing and Saying “No”</a></h1>
        <p class="screen-reader-hide"><small>by Tim Smith</small></p>

        <p>No. That word has been given lots of importance in our industry and rightly so. <a href="http://vimeo.com/53155584">Jason Santa Maria spoke about it</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/23ad80bdfbc">Julie Zhuo wrote about it</a>, and I’m sure you’ve read your fair share of articles on the topic. </p>

<p>It’s a powerful word, and I’m glad that we’re a community that looks out for each other and is willing to share with newcomers how to avoid bad projects. There are some relationships that will rob you of your joy, and in the end cost you more money than you’re being paid.</p>

<p>However, I think it’s been given a misleading reputation. Lots of people confuse saying no,with turning down projects they don’t deem as “fun”. In some articles, I’ve seen it turn into advice that only strokes the growing ego that many designers have. We turn something great, into snobbery and haughtiness. Consequently, people are given the wrong impression of what saying no actually means.</p>

<h3 id="tim-my-business-is-already-struggling-and-you-expect-me-to-say-no-to-a-project">“Tim, my business is already struggling and you expect me to say no to a project?”</h3>

<p>Of course not. I always take projects that help keep the lights on. Everyone does. If they say they don’t, they’re lying. Not every single project will meet all of your requirements <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, and even the ones that do will have difficulties and moments of frustration. That’s just a fact of life.</p>

<p>Saying no means to turn down projects that will kill you or your business. You know exactly what I’m talking about. The client that you’re having a preliminary meeting with, and your gut tells you that you shouldn’t work with the person. The reason could be one of many. They don’t know what they want, they want to pay you considerably less, they’re condescending, whatever. That’s when you say no.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that someone with a low budget isn’t always a red flag. Learn to trust your gut. You’ll know when it’s a good idea to work for less money, and when it’s just someone that’s trying to take advantage. If you still don’t know, ask a friend. Don’t have someone to ask? Email me.</p>

<h3 id="but-i-need-the-money">“But I need the money!”</h3>

<p>You think you’re poor now? Just wait till you’re working an insane amount of hours on an insane budget. What happens when you finally get sick of it? Do you fire the client? Will you have to issue a refund? How do you pay for that?</p>

<p>Trust me, something else will come up. I’ve been hours away from having no money in the bank with no prospects of money, and something has always come up.In all honesty, it’s better to pick up a shift at Starbucks, than work in a toxic relationship.</p>

<h3 id="im-freelancing-so-i-can-have-fun">“I’m freelancing so I can have fun.”</h3>

<p>Freelancing is work. There are a lot of hardships. Lots of anxiety. Lots of stress. Maybe even playing “credit card shuffle”. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Not every day is going to be fun, and that’s something you have to come to terms with. However, it’s also very rewarding. I wake up when I want, I work when I want, I get to choose my clients,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> I can choose to collaborate with other designers, developers, etc., and I can work from wherever there is internet.</p>

<p>You’ll land three projects one month, and have no work the next.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> Money management becomes crucial when you freelance. But, don’t worry. If I can do it—and I’m literally the best blower of money—you can definitely do it.</p>

<h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h3>

<p>All projects aren’t going to be fun, and they won’t all be big brands or names. Learn to appreciate projects that allow you to work with people who care, make an impact on peoples lives, and teach you new things.</p>

<p>Not all clients are bad. Most are well-meaning people who are trying to do their best by their business or company. Saying no, should never satisfy an emotional need to rebel. Instead, it should be educated by the goals of your business, and that of the client. </p>

<p>In closing, remember that the objective of saying no, will give you the opportunity to say yes.</p>

      <p>You’re the one that decides what those requirements are. For me, I have an internal checklist. Is the project fun? Do I believe in the message of the project and the company trying to communicate it? Does the client show respect for me, my work, and my time? Who else will I be working with? What will I learn?

        <p>Josh Ong reporting for <em>The Next Web</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fitbit CEO James Park said the company is “inching closer and closer to being a smartwatch.”</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>Park also emphasized that Fitbit is vertically focused on the health and fitness space, so it’s not worried about smartwatches that are rumored to be coming from Apple and Google.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s very smart of Fitbit, because they have no chance in competing with Google or Apple, if these rumors are true. For some, a “smartwatch”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> will be overkill for tracking their health and fitness. However, if their products serve the niche market well, they have the opportunity to continue being very successful in the space.</p>

        <p>Stuff like this is just so cool. I need to find ways to hide things on the sites I design. </p>

        <blockquote>
  <p>The most conscious decision I made about openness was to not put up a front and not always try to make myself look better. We all do things that make us look stupid from time to time (I do it a lot!). But what’s really wrong with looking stupid? Why would I want to pretend to be superhuman? That would just set unrealistic expectations for my clients and everybody else around me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Laura is one of my favorite people. She’s real, she’s humble, and crazy talented. That combination of qualities have made her the success she is. In her column today, on <em>A List Apart</em>, she does a great job explaining why being open and transparent is a very good thing.</p>

  <p>To use Square Cash, all you do is compose an email to a friend, type the amount you way to pay in the subject title, and cc cash@square.com. If it’s your first time using the service, you’re directed to Square’s website where you type in your debit card number — and you’re done. There are no accounts to create, apps to download, friends to add, surcharges to pay, or bank account numbers to look up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is amazing. My only question is: why has this taken so long? It seems that this could’ve existed years ago. Good on Square for continuing to do great things.</p>

        <p>Dan Seifert from <em>The Verge</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Compared to the similarly priced Jambox, the Play:1 is considerably louder, crisper, and more present. The more expensive Big Jambox offers a wider range and better separation than a single Play:1 thanks to its larger speakers and configuration. But the Play:1 is still louder and sounds bigger, if slightly more muddled because of the lack of speaker separation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really excited about this news. Since receiving my new iPhone, I now need to replace by bathroom speaker because it uses the old 30-pin connector. I started thinking that it would be better to buy things that are connector-independent, this way, it’ll last me longer. </p>

<p>I’d looked at several speakers, and had heard very good things of all the Sonos speakers and <a href="https://jawbone.com/speakers/bigjambox">Big Jambox</a>, but was worried to go Sonos because of the high price point. This new speaker is more wallet friendly, and could be the start of a great relationship with the Sonos ecosystem. I’ll write some thoughts on the speaker once I receive and use it for a while.</p>

        <p>Jon Russell reporting for <em>The Next Web</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instagram announced earlier this month that it will begin serving in-feed advertising before the end of the year, and the Facebook-owned photo and video app has made a subtle, but important, change after it removed the option to switch off autoplay for videos on iOS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know what to say. Do I like that Instagram is about to be Facebook-ized? No. But, the fact of the matter is, that they weren’t profitable, and now they have to be. Is there a better way? Maybe. But what is it? I have no idea. </p>

<p>Here’s what I do know: I hate quotes like this, where Instagram says they want “these ads to be enjoyable and creative in much the same way you see engaging, high-quality ads when you flip through your favorite magazine.” Guess what? Everyone, <em>everyone</em>, flips right past them.</p>

<p>But, what are they supposed to do? If they offered some type of subscription, it wouldn’t make enough to sustain the business. If they <em>only</em> allowed paying customers, they’d loose their core user base of adolescents and young adults. They could offer filters as an in-app purchase, <a href="http://favd.net/">like Favd does</a>, but I have no idea whether that would make enough.</p>

<p>So, as much as it bothers me that they’ve gone the advertising route, I can’t help but empathize. I myself put ads on this site, and on my podcast. It’s easy, it often pays the bills, and sometimes more. </p>

        <p>The <em>Associated Press</em> reports:</p>

  <p>Facebook Inc. said Thursday that it is removing a setting that controls whether users could be found when people type their name into the website’s search bar.</p>

  <p>Facebook says only a single-digit percentage of the nearly 1.2 billion people on its network were using the setting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is Facebook without their continued unethical behavior involving privacy. And then to say “only a single-digit percentage of the nearly 1.2 billion people on its network” are using it? As <a href="https://twitter.com/tubes/status/388505400527450113">Sean Tubridy pointed out so well</a>, that’s “between 10 million and 90 million people.”</p>

<p>What Facebook seems to forget, is that what’s bad for users, is bad for business. A lesson they might learn the hard way.</p>

  <p>Microsoft has made a number of recent decisions contrary to HP’s own interests, including bailing out competitor Dell in an attempt to push Windows 8 to the business sector. Also central to her reclassification is Microsoft’s commitment to Surface, despite previous claims from HP that Surface wasn’t a threat to its own Windows 8 tablet.</p>

<p>We all could see this coming. As Microsoft moves to create their own hardware, the companies that have built business around that not being the case, are now in trouble. HP didn’t help itself either, by making <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/2/2533759/slate-2-hp-tries-tablets-again-with-windows-swype-and-a-stylus-for-699">horrible tablets</a>.</p>
