        <div class="post__entry">
          <p>Yesterday, I went out and got myself an iPhone 6.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I’ve had an iPhone since the iPhone 4, and at first I had a screen protector on it, and a bulky case.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> When I upgraded to an 5s last year, I decided that I wasn’t going to use a case anymore. I wanted it naked so as to not devalue the beauty and design of the phone.</p>

<figure class="extendout"><img src="http://theboldreport.net/uploads/2014/10/iPhone5s-front.jpg" /><figcaption>My iPhone 5s on the front side. You'll notice no huge scratches or dings.</figcaption></figure>

<p>It wasn’t that bad. The phone did pretty well on some minor drops. I made it a point to treat the phone as if it had a case, but still take care of it as much as possible. In my opinion, the phone still looks pretty great, but I’ve included some pictures<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> for you to judge yourself.</p>

<figure class="alignright"><img src="http://theboldreport.net/uploads/2014/10/iphone5s-back.jpg" /><figcaption>The back side of my iPhone 5s. Again no scratches! I've had this phone for a year, and that it's in such great condition without a case, is pretty surprising.</figcaption></figure>

<p>With that said, when I got the new iPhone, I decided to look into cases just for kicks. <em>The Wirecutter</em> did an amazing review of cases, and in fact they recommend one as “the best (so far)”. I’ve linked the full article and review above. If you’re also looking for a case, I think you’ll find their opinions interesting. I ordered one, and will write something on it once I’ve used it for a month or two.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

      <p>This is the first impulse buy that I’ve made in a really long time. My girlfriend had to get a new phone, and she went with the iPhone 6. After seeing it, I just had to have it.  <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>If you remember that phone, you’ll remember that the actual phone was bulky, so you’re basically carrying around a brick with a case on it. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>One review on Youtube said, “Some people complain about the wear on this case. I’ve had it for a couple of days, and I haven’t noticed any wear.” Really? Maybe it’s because you’ve only had the case for a couple of days?! <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

          <p>Some awesome news on <em>The Verge</em> today:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone expected a third Avengers film a few years from now, but Marvel has a surprise for you: you’ll be getting two of them. The third Avengers film is called Avengers: Infinity War, and it’s being broken into two parts: its first part is being released on May 4th, 2018, and its second part is being released on May 3rd, 2019.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marvel has done such an amazing job with all these different films. I hope that DC gets their act together because they have great characters to work with too. Who knows? Maybe the Batman vs. Superman film will be a great start.</p>

          <p>Using Jekyll instead of a CMS like WordPress, means that some things aren’t automated like before. With WordPress, when you publish a new post, the system automatically pings services around the web letting them know you’ve published new content. </p>

<p>We can use Rake to do this. If you use Jekyll together with FeedPress for your RSS Feed, this Gist helps you write a simple Rake task that interacts with the FeedPress API.</p>

<p>Easy peasy.</p>

  <p>Spend just a bit of time with [Yosemite], and you can almost picture the iterations to come, when future releases will have fully worked out the visual language and the gestalt of the interface will have cohered to a more advanced state. OS X Balboa and OS X Palisades are going to look great.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, though, I find Yosemite lacking in polish, full of awkward decisions and unresolved tensions.</p>

        <div class="post__entry">
          <p>John Gruber on <em>Daring Fireball</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Think about what they’re doing. They’re turning off NFC payment systems — the whole thing — only because people were actually using them with Apple Pay. Apple Pay works so well that it even works with non-partner systems. These things have been installed for years and so few people used them, apparently, that these retailers would rather block everyone than allow Apple Pay to continue working. I can’t imagine a better validation of Apple Pay’s appeal.</p>

  <p>And the reason they don’t want to allow Apple Pay is because Apple Pay doesn’t give them any personal information about the customer. It’s not about security — Apple Pay is far more secure than any credit/debit card system in the U.S. It’s not about money — Apple’s tiny slice of the transaction comes from the banks, not the merchants. It’s about data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This whole thing is very interesting. I wouldn’t go as far to conclude that Apple is the white knight in this situation—the one looking out for our best interest. The situation just happens to be in Apple’s favor. They seem to be getting everything they need to make payments easier, whereas retailers are not. And what is it that they want? Coming as no surprise: customer data.</p>

        <div class="post__entry">
          <p>Federico Viticci writing on <em>MacStories</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With version 2.2, Flexibits has built a powerful share extension that brings the full Fantastical interface to any app that can share text and links. From Safari, Drafts, Digg, and other iOS 8 apps that properly support share extensions, you’ll be able to tap the Fantastical icon to get the app’s complete UI for event and reminder creation.</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>What I like about Fantastical’s share extension is that it’s not a compromise – unlike other iOS 8 app updates, it’s not a bare-bones share sheet where you can type text with no other controls or menus. Flexibits has brought the full-blown Fantastical UI to a share sheet that has all the controls you’re used to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Federico, as usual, writes an excellent review on Fantastical 2.2. When I say excellent, I not only mean that he loves the update, but his attention to what makes a calendar great is on point. This looks like a great update.</p>

          <p>Hi Reader,</p>

<p>I’m taking a quick moment to write you about the new design on <em>The Bold Report</em>. This is the second redesign of this site, and its third major incarnation. If you normally read links and articles via your RSS reader, please take a moment to take a look.</p>

<p>I’ve been up to a lot lately. <a href="http://instagram.com/p/saorGTycIO/">Exciting things are happening in my personal life</a>, <a href="http://theboldreport.net/2014/10/the-east-wing-is-back/">The East Wing is back</a>, <a href="http://goodstuff.fm/dailycolumn">I started a daily show</a>, and <a href="http://ttimsmith.com/membership">a membership I launched</a> about a month ago already has seven members that are supporting my online work.</p>

<p>With all of that, I’ve decided it was time to get back into this site. With all my different commitments and my client work, I can’t commit to the daily posting of times past, but I would like to start writing useful articles and links again. I have a Sonos Play:1 review that I’ve been writing for almost a year, that I just need to buckle down and actually finish. Over the next few weeks, links and articles will begin to ramp up again which I’m really excited about.</p>

<p>All in all, if you’ve been a fan of this site, I hope your patience and support will soon pay off.</p>

<p>Thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p>

<p>Best, <br />
Timmy Tim Tim</p>

          <p>I started a new show. It’s called The Daily Radio Column.</p>

<p>When I was fifteen, I started a small column that I would write everyday. “Column” is a fancy word for it, really. More accurately, it was me at my computer, with Microsoft Word open (thank goodness those days are gone), writing my thoughts on the world around me.</p>

<p>Recently, I found some of these, and naturally they’re terrible. But it reminded me of the importance of practicing something, and how cathardic it can be to externalize your feelings on what’s happening around you.</p>

<p>That is what I want this show to be, and I hope you’ll join me for the ride.</p>

        <div class="post__entry">
          <p>Today is an exciting day. My friends, Stephen Hackett and Myke Hurley, have announced their new project: <a href="http://relay.fm">Relay FM</a>.</p>

<p>Relay FM is their new network, that will house some of their classic shows, and a few new ones. I for one, am very excited for them. My sentiments align very much with <a href="http://www.chrisenns.com/2014/08/relay-fm/">Chris’</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In as much as some­one might think a new pod­cast net­work would be bad and add com­pe­ti­tion to <a href="http://goodstuff.fm/">what I’m work­ing on</a>, it’s really not the case. Pod­cast­ing needs to become more famil­iar to more peo­ple so that we all rise together. And the only way that’s going to hap­pen is by hav­ing qual­ity pod­casts that draw peo­ple in to the medium.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this new addition to the podcasting landscape is great for us as a whole. And really, the shows Myke and Stephen work on can’t really be called “new”. It’s more of a continuation of the amazing work they’ve already been doing.</p>

<p>Also, I’m incredibly excited that Relay FM is powered by the CMS that <a href="https://twitter.com/willmanduffy">Will Duffy</a> and I created. The fact that we got to work on a project like this is beyond awesome.</p>

<p>With that said, do your ears a favor, and follow the happenings of Relay FM. It’ll be some <em>goodstuff™</em>.</p>

          <p>Marco Arment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The app market is becoming a mature, developed industry, with vastly increased commoditization compared to its early days. Competition is ubiquitous, relentless, and often shameless, even in categories that were previously under-the-radar niches. Standing out requires more effort than ever, yet profits are harder to come by than ever.</p>

  <p>Full-time iOS indie developers — people who make the majority of their income from sales of their apps, rather than consulting or other related work — are increasingly rare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The struggle of the indie developer is real. It all points to the burst of a bubble we’ve been enjoying the past few of years. I for one, hope those of us who work hard to create quality work can survive the impact.</p>

          <p>The quality of shows that Moisés Chiullan produces is by far one of the best. He’s an expert moderator, and his passion for the topics really shines through.</p>

<p>In this episode of Giant Size, they talk about Captain America. The panel, consisting of Moisés, John Gholson, Brad Graeber and Amanda Schuckman, gives such a detailed backstory helping me understand the character a lot better.</p>

<p>Give it a listen. In fact, listen to all the ESN shows.</p>

          <p>Chris Welch reporting for <em>The Verge</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Amazon and HBO have signed an extensive, multi-year agreement that will bring many of the premium channel’s greatest shows including The Sopranos, Six Feet Under, and The Wire to Amazon Prime Instant Video. The deal also includes “early” seasons of Boardwalk Empire and True Blood. Newer shows like Girls, The Newsroom and Veep will eventually be made available to Prime subscribers, but not until three years after they’ve first aired on HBO. And other hits like Game of Thrones aren’t even mentioned as part of the deal, so HBO may be holding at least some popular content away from Amazon’s on-demand streaming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Big move by HBO. Their first deal that doesn’t require a cable subscription; a move I never thought possible considering their parent company is Time Warner.</p>

<p>However, the deal doesn’t include new shows. HBO’s back catalogue is great, but most people are hungry for their latest shows. But let’s say we’re ok with getting older episodes, how long are we supposed to wait? <em>“Three years after they’ve first aired on HBO.”</em> Ridiculous. While this is progress, they need to do better.</p>

        <div class="post__entry">
          <p>On March 17th, I launched <a href="http://goodstuff.fm/">Goodstuff Broadcasting</a> together with my good friends <a href="https://twitter.com/ichris">Chris Enns</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/avclark">Adam Clark</a>.</p>

<p>On April 8th we did a more official launch where we did live broadcasting for eight hours, and it was one of the funnest things I’ve done in a long time. We finally got to see this thing that we’ve planned and worked on for months, in the wild. The best part? People seemed to like it.</p>

<p>Goodstuff is by no means a huge network. However, we saw from the beginning that we have a core of amazing people who listen to our shows. I can’t tell you how grateful I am about that. If you listen to our shows, a heartfelt thank you to you.</p>

<p>So what are we doing? What are we trying to accomplish? What makes us different?</p>

<p>Those are great questions. We want to produce entertaining and educational content spanning technology (of course), culture, news, and more. As time goes by, we’d like to do shows that cover the different niches of these topics better, but we’re doing a fantastic job for a one month old network.</p>

<p>In terms of what we want to accomplish, all three of us want to do this full time. As you may have heard on <a href="http://goodstuff.fm/tirp/31">the latest episode of The Intellectual Radio Program</a>, I’m so burnt out with the web. I’d love to make a transition into something else.</p>

<p>What makes us different? That’s actually quite simple: we’re a group of nice people working hard to make great content. Unfortunately, that’s becoming a big differentiator nowadays.</p>

<p>If you like what we’re doing, and would like to help us out, you can do that in couple of ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/goodstuff_fm">Follow us on Twitter.</a></strong> Twitter is what we use to notify everyone of shows recording live, recently published episodes, and shows we’ve added to our network.</li>
  <li><strong>Sign up for our newsletter.</strong> Chris does some really fun things with <a href="http://goodstuff.fm/newsletter">the newsletter</a>. He updates you on the latest episodes, Goodstuff news, and more. In fact, I owe him some behind-the-scenes content about <a href="http://goodstuff.fm/fullscreen">Fullscreen</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Share your favorite episodes.</strong> If you really enjoyed an episode of a show, or like the whole show in general, share it with people. Word of mouth recommendations are the best and are usually trusted a lot more. </li>
  <li><strong>Rate and Review in iTunes.</strong> This we really appreciate. We don’t really understand the black magic that is the iTunes podcast directory, but we hear that ratings and reviews don’t hurt. Plus, hosts love to see reviews of their shows. The review doesn’t have to be positive, but it <em>should be</em> useful and constructive. You can find the iTunes page for our different shows <a href="http://goodstuff.fm/broadcasts">here</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Check out our sponsors.</strong> We really appreciate our sponsors. They give us money to do something we all love doing. But, they also give us money in the hope to reach you. That’s the reality of advertising. However, because we care about both sides, we only advertise things we like and use. This way, instead of it being <em>advertising</em>, it’s more of a friend-to-friend recommendation.</li>
  <li><strong>Bonus: Buy a T-shirt.</strong> You’ve got about five hours left to <a href="http://teespring.com/goodstuff_fm">get a Goodstuff t-shirt</a>. A huge shoutout to <a href="http://stevaker.com">Steve</a> for making us such a rocking logo.</li>
</ol>

<p>In closing, thank you so much for supporting my projects. I can’t tell you how excited I am, to finally be doing this with people I love to work with. It’s the first time I’m part of a founding team, and actually enjoy it. In a short time, we’ve built a company and network that I feel fortunate and proud to be part of. </p>

          <p>I had just seen an app called <a href="http://coffitivity.com/hush/">Hush</a> that turns off notifications on your Mac. It allows you to toggle notifications or specify a period of time in which to disable them. Turns out, it’s baked into Mac OS X. As Sven points out, this is a great way in which Apple brought a feature in iOS, “back to the Mac.”</p>
