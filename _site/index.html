          <p>Steven Aquino for <em>MacStories</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The second problem with Apple’s implementation of third-party keyboards is they don’t have all the bells and whistles that the system keyboard does. To wit: no access to dictation or autocorrect; neither do they have access to the tap-and-hold-the-globe-button gesture to switch between keyboards. As well, switching from a light to dark keyboard for day/night, and using the <code>UIKit</code> blur effect is also disallowed by Apple.</p>

  <p>All in all, the limitations that Apple imposes on developers rolling their own keyboards make them less attractive to customers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fascinating article. I hope Apple loosens its grip on the keyboards. Till then, developers can’t make the experience users truly want.</p>

          <p>Khoi Vinh on <em>Subtraction.com</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s now more than ten days after they went on sale, and yet there have been no sales figure announcements, no bragging about new record-breaking numbers of iPads pre-ordered, no new milestones in adoption reached. There’s just silence. In and of itself that might not be remarkable, but the lack of news around sales numbers seems especially suspicious given that iPad sales have declined now for three quarters in a row.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This goes to show how behind I am. I had no idea that the iPad was in decline. It wasn’t until after I read the article that I realized that not much has been done for the iPad in its most recent iterations.</p>

<p>The iPad has become a vital device for me, and many of my friends—not all in tech—feel the same. Yet for the iPad to thrive, it needs more of a commitment from Apple. Khoi says it best:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What will it take to get there? The short answer is a new commitment from Apple to this product line, and a willingness to reexamine the company’s entire approach to date.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope Apple does the right thing. </p>

I’ve only had it three days, which isn’t enough time to write a thorough review, but just enough time for me to tell you that I love it.</p>

<p>I received the case on Friday. I put it on and almost immediately fell in love with it. It’s light, and is thin enough to look great on the phone, but not to the point where you feel like nothing is being protected. The material is a perfect balance of soft yet firm. The case gives you more grip on the phone without being a nuisance to put in or take out of pockets. </p>

<p>Again, I’ve said before that I hate cases, but this case came to change everything. My first impressions are very good, and I see myself using this case in the long term. If you have hesitated at all to buy this case and had some of the same issues I did, hesitate no more. Keep on the lookout for a more in-depth review in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Cory Doctorow reporting for <em>Boing Boing</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shoshana B Roberts spent 10 hours walking the streets of New York with a hidden camera crew, documenting over 100 catcalls (plus countless less-visible forms of harassment), as part of a campaign from Hollaback, who work to fight street harassment of women.</p>

  <p>Within a day, she had over a million views – and a totally predictable passel of rape-threats from creeps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is sad. The ensuing rape threats are not only utterly disgusting, they further prove the necessity for awareness on street harassment. Cat calling is not a compliment. The never ending focus on the female appearance is a problem that transcends our industry, and each of us can do our part in being respectful.</p>

        <div class="post__entry">
          <p>Yesterday, I went out and got myself an iPhone 6.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I’ve had an iPhone since the iPhone 4, and at first I had a screen protector on it, and a bulky case.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> When I upgraded to an 5s last year, I decided that I wasn’t going to use a case anymore. I wanted it naked so as to not devalue the beauty and design of the phone.</p>

<figure class="extendout"><img src="http://theboldreport.net/uploads/2014/10/iPhone5s-front.jpg" /><figcaption>My iPhone 5s on the front side. You'll notice no huge scratches or dings.</figcaption></figure>

<p>It wasn’t that bad. The phone did pretty well on some minor drops. I made it a point to treat the phone as if it had a case, but still take care of it as much as possible. In my opinion, the phone still looks pretty great, but I’ve included some pictures<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> for you to judge yourself.</p>

<figure class="alignright"><img src="http://theboldreport.net/uploads/2014/10/iPhone5s-back.jpg" /><figcaption>The back side of my iPhone 5s. Again no scratches! I've had this phone for a year, and that it's in such great condition without a case, is pretty surprising.</figcaption></figure>

<p>With that said, when I got the new iPhone, I decided to look into cases just for kicks. <em>The Wirecutter</em> did an amazing review of cases, and in fact they recommend one as “the best (so far)”. I’ve linked the full article and review above. If you’re also looking for a case, I think you’ll find their opinions interesting. I ordered one, and will write something on it once I’ve used it for a month or two.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

      <p>One review on Youtube said, “Some people complain about the wear on this case. I’ve had it for a couple of days, and I haven’t noticed any wear.” Really? Maybe it’s because you’ve only had the case for a couple of days?! <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

          <p>Some awesome news on <em>The Verge</em> today:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone expected a third Avengers film a few years from now, but Marvel has a surprise for you: you’ll be getting two of them. The third Avengers film is called Avengers: Infinity War, and it’s being broken into two parts: its first part is being released on May 4th, 2018, and its second part is being released on May 3rd, 2019.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marvel has done such an amazing job with all these different films. I hope that DC gets their act together because they have great characters to work with too. Who knows? Maybe the Batman vs. Superman film will be a great start.</p>

          <p>Using Jekyll instead of a CMS like WordPress, means that some things aren’t automated like before. With WordPress, when you publish a new post, the system automatically pings services around the web letting them know you’ve published new content. </p>

<p>We can use Rake to do this. If you use Jekyll together with FeedPress for your RSS Feed, this Gist helps you write a simple Rake task that interacts with the FeedPress API.</p>

        <div class="post__entry">
          <p>John Gruber on <em>Daring Fireball</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Think about what they’re doing. They’re turning off NFC payment systems — the whole thing — only because people were actually using them with Apple Pay. Apple Pay works so well that it even works with non-partner systems. These things have been installed for years and so few people used them, apparently, that these retailers would rather block everyone than allow Apple Pay to continue working. I can’t imagine a better validation of Apple Pay’s appeal.</p>

  <p>And the reason they don’t want to allow Apple Pay is because Apple Pay doesn’t give them any personal information about the customer. It’s not about security — Apple Pay is far more secure than any credit/debit card system in the U.S. It’s not about money — Apple’s tiny slice of the transaction comes from the banks, not the merchants. It’s about data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This whole thing is very interesting. I wouldn’t go as far to conclude that Apple is the white knight in this situation—the one looking out for our best interest. The situation just happens to be in Apple’s favor. They seem to be getting everything they need to make payments easier, whereas retailers are not. And what is it that they want? Coming as no surprise: customer data.</p>

          <p>Federico Viticci writing on <em>MacStories</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With version 2.2, Flexibits has built a powerful share extension that brings the full Fantastical interface to any app that can share text and links. From Safari, Drafts, Digg, and other iOS 8 apps that properly support share extensions, you’ll be able to tap the Fantastical icon to get the app’s complete UI for event and reminder creation.</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>What I like about Fantastical’s share extension is that it’s not a compromise – unlike other iOS 8 app updates, it’s not a bare-bones share sheet where you can type text with no other controls or menus. Flexibits has brought the full-blown Fantastical UI to a share sheet that has all the controls you’re used to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Federico, as usual, writes an excellent review on Fantastical 2.2. When I say excellent, I not only mean that he loves the update, but his attention to what makes a calendar great is on point. This looks like a great update.</p>

          <p>Hi Reader,</p>

<p>I’m taking a quick moment to write you about the new design on <em>The Bold Report</em>. This is the second redesign of this site, and its third major incarnation. If you normally read links and articles via your RSS reader, please take a moment to take a look.</p>

<p>I’ve been up to a lot lately. <a href="http://instagram.com/p/saorGTycIO/">Exciting things are happening in my personal life</a>, <a href="http://theboldreport.net/2014/10/the-east-wing-is-back/">The East Wing is back</a>, <a href="http://goodstuff.fm/dailycolumn">I started a daily show</a>, and <a href="http://ttimsmith.com/membership">a membership I launched</a> about a month ago already has seven members that are supporting my online work.</p>

<p>With all of that, I’ve decided it was time to get back into this site. With all my different commitments and my client work, I can’t commit to the daily posting of times past, but I would like to start writing useful articles and links again. I have a Sonos Play:1 review that I’ve been writing for almost a year, that I just need to buckle down and actually finish. Over the next few weeks, links and articles will begin to ramp up again which I’m really excited about.</p>

<p>All in all, if you’ve been a fan of this site, I hope your patience and support will soon pay off.</p>

<p>Thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p>

<p>Best, <br />
Timmy Tim Tim</p>

          <p>I started a new show. It’s called The Daily Radio Column.</p>

<p>When I was fifteen, I started a small column that I would write everyday. “Column” is a fancy word for it, really. More accurately, it was me at my computer, with Microsoft Word open (thank goodness those days are gone), writing my thoughts on the world around me.</p>

<p>Recently, I found some of these, and naturally they’re terrible. But it reminded me of the importance of practicing something, and how cathardic it can be to externalize your feelings on what’s happening around you.</p>

<p>That is what I want this show to be, and I hope you’ll join me for the ride.</p>

        <div class="post__entry">
          <p>Today is an exciting day. My friends, Stephen Hackett and Myke Hurley, have announced their new project: <a href="http://relay.fm">Relay FM</a>.</p>

<p>Relay FM is their new network, that will house some of their classic shows, and a few new ones. I for one, am very excited for them. My sentiments align very much with <a href="http://www.chrisenns.com/2014/08/relay-fm/">Chris’</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In as much as some­one might think a new pod­cast net­work would be bad and add com­pe­ti­tion to <a href="http://goodstuff.fm/">what I’m work­ing on</a>, it’s really not the case. Pod­cast­ing needs to become more famil­iar to more peo­ple so that we all rise together. And the only way that’s going to hap­pen is by hav­ing qual­ity pod­casts that draw peo­ple in to the medium.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this new addition to the podcasting landscape is great for us as a whole. And really, the shows Myke and Stephen work on can’t really be called “new”. It’s more of a continuation of the amazing work they’ve already been doing.</p>

<p>Also, I’m incredibly excited that Relay FM is powered by the CMS that <a href="https://twitter.com/willmanduffy">Will Duffy</a> and I created. The fact that we got to work on a project like this is beyond awesome.</p>

<p>With that said, do your ears a favor, and follow the happenings of Relay FM. It’ll be some <em>goodstuff™</em>.</p>

          <p>Marco Arment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The app market is becoming a mature, developed industry, with vastly increased commoditization compared to its early days. Competition is ubiquitous, relentless, and often shameless, even in categories that were previously under-the-radar niches. Standing out requires more effort than ever, yet profits are harder to come by than ever.</p>

  <p>Full-time iOS indie developers — people who make the majority of their income from sales of their apps, rather than consulting or other related work — are increasingly rare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The struggle of the indie developer is real. It all points to the burst of a bubble we’ve been enjoying the past few of years. I for one, hope those of us who work hard to create quality work can survive the impact.</p>
