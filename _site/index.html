        <p>Jim Dalrymple on <em>The Loop</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple on Monday reported its fourth quarter results, posting revenue of $37.5 billion and a profit of $7.5 billion. This compares to revenue of $36 billion and net profit of $8.2 billion in the year-ago quarter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love Apple, but the amount of success they have is sickening at times. This is a stupid amount of money.</p>

  <p>Something felt a bit off about this week’s Apple event.</p>

  <p>Part of it was the lack of surprises, which isn’t Apple’s fault. All of the product upgrades, while nice, were incremental and predictable. None of the pricing was a surprise. In fact, the only unexpected product announcement is the zombie iPad 2 sticking around for another year, shamelessly at the same price as last year.</p>

<p>I agree. It felt weird, and ended abruptly.</p>

        <p>While I admire all the hard work that went in creating this new version of Tweetbot, I can’t help be a little disappointed. The app has lost much of its personality; both visually and sonically. The new app has some very well done animations, but unfortunately looks too “default iOS 7” for my taste. </p>

<p>However, I did purchase because I respect the work of Tapbots very much and I want to support them. They have the reputation of making incredible things, and I look forward to seeing the betterment of Tweetbot.</p>

        <p>Rachel Andrew writing on <em>A List Apart</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Almost every conference’s second day opens with attendees being asked how their hangovers are. Second day early-slot speakers joke that no one will turn up anyway, or they’ll all just be staring into their coffee. It has become normal, in fact expected, that drinking and staying out late is what we do while at conferences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Rachel brings up a very real issue with our conferences and events. Because our industry is very friendly, and social, it seems we might be blurring the lines of professional time and social time, a bit too much. She goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re also underlining that our events are for over-18s, maybe even over-21s, by holding them in licensed premises. Most of us know students or even those who are working professionally in our field long before they are “adult.” Should they be excluded?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy having drinks—and the article isn’t advocating for the banishment of alcohol—but I remember being the seventeen year-old kid that couldn’t drink. I’ve always been very extroverted, so it never stopped me from talking to people. However, I can see how it could affect others; making them feel excluded and not part of the group, and Rachel’s article does a great job of shining light on that fact.</p>

        <p>Aaron Souppouris reporting for <em>The Verge</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After being caught paying for false praise and negative comments about competitors, Samsung has been fined just over $340,000. The issue first arose internationally in April, when Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission (FTC) announced it was opening an investigation into the allegations. That investigation found the allegations were true: the FTC says Samsung used a “large number of hired writers and designated employees” to post in Taiwanese forums.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Embarrassing. But wait! There’s more!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While Samsung is by no means the first company to engage in astroturfing, it’s been caught in the act twice this year alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only are they engaging in unethical marketing practices—which hilariously enough has an official term—they’ve been caught doing it <em>twice</em> in the same year.</p>

<p>Get your stuff together, Samsung. You’re better than this.</p>

        <p>Frank Shaw on <em>The Official Microsoft Blog</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Surface and Surface 2 both include Office, the world’s most popular, most powerful productivity software for free and are priced below both the iPad 2 and iPad Air respectively. Making Apple’s decision to build the price of their less popular and less powerful iWork into their tablets not a very big (or very good) deal.</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>I think they, like others, are waking up to the fact that we’ve built a better solution for people everywhere, who are getting things done from anywhere, and who don’t have hard lines between their personal and professional lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Microsoft looks incredibly stupid for publishing this garbage.</p>

<p>Who cares that you made a device you think “is the most productive tablet you can buy today,” when it’s not selling? Eighty-one percent of tablet usage is on the iPad, and I highly doubt that the Surface has a significant share of the remaining nineteen percent.</p>

<p>Microsoft has so much untapped potential they could use for making great new products. Instead, they waste their time writing a post like this that claims they understand “how people work better than anyone else.” Talk is cheap, but the fact is this: while Microsoft was busy loosing $900 million on Surface tablets in Q3 2013, Apple sold 14.6 million iPads.</p>

Nine people visited from Internet Explorer.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Most visitors are using a Mac, but twelve percent is on Windows.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bones haven’t changed all that much over the last 13 years, but every time Apple updates OS X, it continues to improve and refine features and the underlying technologies that make them possible.</p>

  <p>…I firmly believe that OS X is the best consumer desktop operating system on the planet. It has undergone some major changes over the years, but it’s the same OS under the hood. OS X is still as stable, powerful and resilient to viruses and other malware as it has always been.</p>

<p>Stephen is one of my favorite writers, and he’s published an amazing, in-depth review of the latest OS X. </p>

<p>After the event, Chris Enns, Kyle Roderick, and myself will be talking about the event and new gadgets on the <a href="http://www.ssktn.com/live/">SSKTN live stream</a>.</p>

<p>Happy Apple Event Day!</p>

      <p>I’m so glad they’ve started to stream most of these events on the Apple TV. It seems that the only one they’re not streaming live these days is WWDC, which is totally understandable. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

        <blockquote>
  <p>What Quarkslab’s research proves […] is that Apple’s iMessage back-end <em>could</em> be designed to allow for Apple to intercept and read message content, and there is no way we, as iMessage users, would be able to detect it.</p>

  <p>What Apple has said, and reiterated today, is that iMessage’s back-end is not in fact designed in that way — that there is no mechanism in the system for Apple employees to surreptitiously change the encryption key to allow for messages to be decrypted during transit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t have much to add to this one, I just found the article to be interesting. I agree with Gruber that it would be a <em>huge</em> mistake for Apple to lie about something as sensitive as this. <strong>However</strong>, at the end of the day, which side does it make more sense for companies to side with? Users? That’s naive.</p>

        <p>Amar Toor reporting for <em>The Verge</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to analysis from Needham &amp; Co., it’s likely that Netflix’s paid US subscriber base reached 30 million by the end of September. That may be enough to overtake HBO, which has an estimated 28.7 million subscribers in the US…</p>

  <p>In its fiscal <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/22/4545446/netflix-q2-2013-earnings">Q2 earnings report</a> this year, Netflix said it had more than 29 million US subscribers and expected to add between 230,000 and 880,000 in Q3.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Netflix is one of those companies that I love to root for. However, as <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/21/4861624/netflix-has-likely-overtaken-hbo-in-paid-us-subscribers-analysts-say#192210067">someone in the comments for this article pointed out</a>, the fact that Netflix has more subscribers than HBO, doesn’t mean they’re making more money. Still, these numbers might just give HBO the scare they need, to consider an online subscription that isn’t tied to any cable company. With Time Warner Cable being the parent company of HBO, I see this as a small probability, but there’s no way they don’t see the potential business they’re missing out on.</p>

<p>One thing is for sure, the competition between these two channels will be interesting to watch. </p>

        <h1><a href="/2013/10/freelancing-and-saying-no">Freelancing and Saying “No”</a></h1>
        <p class="screen-reader-hide"><small>by Tim Smith</small></p>

        <p>No. That word has been given lots of importance in our industry and rightly so. <a href="http://vimeo.com/53155584">Jason Santa Maria spoke about it</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/23ad80bdfbc">Julie Zhuo wrote about it</a>, and I’m sure you’ve read your fair share of articles on the topic. </p>

<p>It’s a powerful word, and I’m glad that we’re a community that looks out for each other and is willing to share with newcomers how to avoid bad projects. There are some relationships that will rob you of your joy, and in the end cost you more money than you’re being paid.</p>

<p>However, I think it’s been given a misleading reputation. Lots of people confuse saying no,with turning down projects they don’t deem as “fun”. In some articles, I’ve seen it turn into advice that only strokes the growing ego that many designers have. We turn something great, into snobbery and haughtiness. Consequently, people are given the wrong impression of what saying no actually means.</p>

<h3 id="tim-my-business-is-already-struggling-and-you-expect-me-to-say-no-to-a-project">“Tim, my business is already struggling and you expect me to say no to a project?”</h3>

<p>Of course not. I always take projects that help keep the lights on. Everyone does. If they say they don’t, they’re lying. Not every single project will meet all of your requirements <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, and even the ones that do will have difficulties and moments of frustration. That’s just a fact of life.</p>

<p>Saying no means to turn down projects that will kill you or your business. You know exactly what I’m talking about. The client that you’re having a preliminary meeting with, and your gut tells you that you shouldn’t work with the person. The reason could be one of many. They don’t know what they want, they want to pay you considerably less, they’re condescending, whatever. That’s when you say no.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that someone with a low budget isn’t always a red flag. Learn to trust your gut. You’ll know when it’s a good idea to work for less money, and when it’s just someone that’s trying to take advantage. If you still don’t know, ask a friend. Don’t have someone to ask? Email me.</p>

<h3 id="but-i-need-the-money">“But I need the money!”</h3>

<p>You think you’re poor now? Just wait till you’re working an insane amount of hours on an insane budget. What happens when you finally get sick of it? Do you fire the client? Will you have to issue a refund? How do you pay for that?</p>

<p>Trust me, something else will come up. I’ve been hours away from having no money in the bank with no prospects of money, and something has always come up.In all honesty, it’s better to pick up a shift at Starbucks, than work in a toxic relationship.</p>

<h3 id="im-freelancing-so-i-can-have-fun">“I’m freelancing so I can have fun.”</h3>

<p>Freelancing is work. There are a lot of hardships. Lots of anxiety. Lots of stress. Maybe even playing “credit card shuffle”. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Not every day is going to be fun, and that’s something you have to come to terms with. However, it’s also very rewarding. I wake up when I want, I work when I want, I get to choose my clients,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> I can choose to collaborate with other designers, developers, etc., and I can work from wherever there is internet.</p>

<p>You’ll land three projects one month, and have no work the next.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> Money management becomes crucial when you freelance. But, don’t worry. If I can do it—and I’m literally the best blower of money—you can definitely do it.</p>

<h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h3>

<p>All projects aren’t going to be fun, and they won’t all be big brands or names. Learn to appreciate projects that allow you to work with people who care, make an impact on peoples lives, and teach you new things.</p>

<p>Not all clients are bad. Most are well-meaning people who are trying to do their best by their business or company. Saying no, should never satisfy an emotional need to rebel. Instead, it should be educated by the goals of your business, and that of the client. </p>

<p>In closing, remember that the objective of saying no, will give you the opportunity to say yes.</p>

      <p>You’re the one that decides what those requirements are. For me, I have an internal checklist. Is the project fun? Do I believe in the message of the project and the company trying to communicate it? Does the client show respect for me, my work, and my time? Who else will I be working with? What will I learn? Will I be able to display the work in my portfolio? Do I have time? Is the budget reasonable? <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

        <p>Josh Ong reporting for <em>The Next Web</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fitbit CEO James Park said the company is “inching closer and closer to being a smartwatch.”</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>Park also emphasized that Fitbit is vertically focused on the health and fitness space, so it’s not worried about smartwatches that are rumored to be coming from Apple and Google.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s very smart of Fitbit, because they have no chance in competing with Google or Apple, if these rumors are true. For some, a “smartwatch”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> will be overkill for tracking their health and fitness. However, if their products serve the niche market well, they have the opportunity to continue being very successful in the space.</p>

  <p>The most conscious decision I made about openness was to not put up a front and not always try to make myself look better.

That would just set unrealistic expectations for my clients and everybody else around me.</p>

<p>Laura is one of my favorite people. She’s real, she’s humble, and crazy talented. That combination of qualities have made her the success she is. In her column today, on <em>A List Apart</em>, she does a great job explaining why being open and transparent is a very good thing.</p>
