        <div class="post__entry">
          <p>I just saw <a href="https://upthemes.com/blog/2014/11/medium-to-wordpress/">this post on UpThemes</a> about migrating your content from Medium to WordPress. Now, I know that they’re just trying to sell their themes, but their comprehension of why people write on Medium is completely wrong.</p>

<p>Before I get into why they’re fundamentally wrong,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I’ll go ahead and say that their reasons why you might not want to be publishing on Medium, are sound. I’m all for owning your content. However, they’re also telling you that you can have everything you have on Medium with WordPress, which is a lie.</p>

<p>People don’t write on Medium just because the reading experience is beautiful; the writing experience is too. WordPress continues to descend into more and more clutter, making writing with it cumbersome and a burden. Sites like Medium give the writer the ability to focus on writing and publishing, whereas WordPress does not.</p>

<p>Personally, it’s the biggest reason I moved over to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Yet the average person doesn’t know how to create a Jekyll site, much less get it on to a server. You could go with something like <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, but then you need to know Node.js.</p>

<p>If your goal is to write, have a great reading and writing experience, own your content, and get your site setup quickly, you solution is definitely not WordPress. In fact, you’re attached to another object by an inclined plane, wrapped helically around an axis,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> because it doesn’t exist.</p>

  <p>Look and feel are important to me when writing. Ulysses and iA Writer both do this well. But I must admit I like that Ulysses allows me to organize my writing, as well as write. Where iA Writer has to be used in tandem with Finder, Ulysses works on its own.</p>

  <p>Scrivener has long been the tool that people recommend for writing long content on the Mac. We’re talking novel length work. But seeing as Scrivener is a bit odd in terms of UI and seems to be updated infrequently, I can see Ulysses challenging in this arena. Ulysses nails the Markdown experience and gives a very solid document management toolset as well.</p>

<p>Interesting non-review—according to Chris—of Ulysses. Seems there’s a healthy amount of apps in this space for everyone’s taste.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The second problem with Apple’s implementation of third-party keyboards is they don’t have all the bells and whistles that the system keyboard does. To wit: no access to dictation or autocorrect; neither do they have access to the tap-and-hold-the-globe-button gesture to switch between keyboards. As well, switching from a light to dark keyboard for day/night, and using the <code>UIKit</code> blur effect is also disallowed by Apple.</p>

  <p>All in all, the limitations that Apple imposes on developers rolling their own keyboards make them less attractive to customers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fascinating article. I hope Apple loosens its grip on the keyboards. Till then, developers can’t make the experience users truly want.</p>

          <p>Khoi Vinh on <em>Subtraction.com</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s now more than ten days after they went on sale, and yet there have been no sales figure announcements, no bragging about new record-breaking numbers of iPads pre-ordered, no new milestones in adoption reached. There’s just silence. In and of itself that might not be remarkable, but the lack of news around sales numbers seems especially suspicious given that iPad sales have declined now for three quarters in a row.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This goes to show how behind I am. I had no idea that the iPad was in decline. It wasn’t until after I read the article that I realized that not much has been done for the iPad in its most recent iterations.</p>

<p>The iPad has become a vital device for me, and many of my friends—not all in tech—feel the same. Yet for the iPad to thrive, it needs more of a commitment from Apple. Khoi says it best:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What will it take to get there? The short answer is a new commitment from Apple to this product line, and a willingness to reexamine the company’s entire approach to date.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope Apple does the right thing. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s very difficult to say we want the legacy to be “It was the funniest show in television history,” but you want it to be appreciated for what I think it was: consistently funny, consistently smart over a long period of time. I felt like we never took the opportunity for granted.</p>

<p>What a great interview. Jon talks about his new film, the news, and the legacy of <em>The Daily Show</em>.</p>

          <p><a href="/2014/10/the-wirecutter-on-the-best-iphone-6-case">As I said last week</a>, I was going to order a <a href="http://www.incipio.com/cases/iphone-cases/iphone-6-cases/ngp-flexible-impact-resistant-case-iphone-6.html">Incipio NGP Case</a> for my new iPhone 6. I’ve only had it three days, which isn’t enough time to write a thorough review, but just enough time for me to tell you that I love it.</p>

<p>I received the case on Friday. I put it on and almost immediately fell in love with it. It’s light, and is thin enough to look great on the phone, but not to the point where you feel like nothing is being protected. The material is a perfect balance of soft yet firm. The case gives you more grip on the phone without being a nuisance to put in or take out of pockets. </p>

<p>Again, I’ve said before that I hate cases, but this case came to change everything. My first impressions are very good, and I see myself using this case in the long term. If you have hesitated at all to buy this case and had some of the same issues I did, hesitate no more. Keep on the lookout for a more in-depth review in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Cory Doctorow reporting for <em>Boing Boing</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shoshana B Roberts spent 10 hours walking the streets of New York with a hidden camera crew, documenting over 100 catcalls (plus countless less-visible forms of harassment), as part of a campaign from Hollaback, who work to fight street harassment of women.</p>

  <p>Within a day, she had over a million views – and a totally predictable passel of rape-threats from creeps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is sad. The ensuing rape threats are not only utterly disgusting, they further prove the necessity for awareness on street harassment. Cat calling is not a compliment. The never ending focus on the female appearance is a problem that transcends our industry, and each of us can do our part in being respectful.</p>

        <div class="post__entry">
          <p>Yesterday, I went out and got myself an iPhone 6.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I’ve had an iPhone since the iPhone 4, and at first I had a screen protector on it, and a bulky case.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> When I upgraded to an 5s last year, I decided that I wasn’t going to use a case anymore. I wanted it naked so as to not devalue the beauty and design of the phone.</p>

<figure class="extendout"><img src="http://theboldreport.net/uploads/2014/10/iPhone5s-front.jpg" /><figcaption>My iPhone 5s on the front side. You'll notice no huge scratches or dings.</figcaption></figure>

<p>It wasn’t that bad. The phone did pretty well on some minor drops. I made it a point to treat the phone as if it had a case, but still take care of it as much as possible. In my opinion, the phone still looks pretty great, but I’ve included some pictures<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> for you to judge yourself.</p>

<figure class="alignright"><img src="http://theboldreport.net/uploads/2014/10/iPhone5s-back.jpg" /><figcaption>The back side of my iPhone 5s. Again no scratches! I've had this phone for a year, and that it's in such great condition without a case, is pretty surprising.</figcaption></figure>

<p>With that said, when I got the new iPhone, I decided to look into cases just for kicks. <em>The Wirecutter</em> did an amazing review of cases, and in fact they recommend one as “the best (so far)”. I’ve linked the full article and review above. If you’re also looking for a case, I think you’ll find their opinions interesting. I ordered one, and will write something on it once I’ve used it for a month or two.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

      <p>This is the first impulse buy that I’ve made in a really long time. My girlfriend had to get a new phone, and she went with the iPhone 6. After seeing it, I just had to have it.  <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>If you remember that phone, you’ll remember that the actual phone was bulky, so you’re basically carrying around a brick with a case on it. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>One review on Youtube said, “Some people complain about the wear on this case. I’ve had it for a couple of days, and I haven’t noticed any wear.” Really? Maybe it’s because you’ve only had the case for a couple of days?! <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

          <p>Some awesome news on <em>The Verge</em> today:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone expected a third Avengers film a few years from now, but Marvel has a surprise for you: you’ll be getting two of them. The third Avengers film is called Avengers: Infinity War, and it’s being broken into two parts: its first part is being released on May 4th, 2018, and its second part is being released on May 3rd, 2019.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marvel has done such an amazing job with all these different films. I hope that DC gets their act together because they have great characters to work with too. Who knows? Maybe the Batman vs. Superman film will be a great start.</p>

        <div class="post__entry">
          <p>Using Jekyll instead of a CMS like WordPress, means that some things aren’t automated like before. With WordPress, when you publish a new post, the system automatically pings services around the web letting them know you’ve published new content. </p>

<p>We can use Rake to do this. If you use Jekyll together with FeedPress for your RSS Feed, this Gist helps you write a simple Rake task that interacts with the FeedPress API.</p>

<p>Easy peasy.</p>
