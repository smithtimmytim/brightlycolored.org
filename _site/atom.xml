    <title>Netflix Breaking From All-At-Once Release Strategy with ‘Turbo Fast’</title>
    <published>2013-12-04T12:17:50-06:00</published>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Chris Welch on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Netflix is deviating from the all-at-once release strategy it’s followed for House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, and the fourth season of Arrested Development. Instead of releasing an entire season on day one, just five episodes of Turbo Fast will be available for streaming on Christmas Eve. Additional new episodes will follow “throughout the year” according to Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting move by Netflix, but one that makes a lot of sense. The article goes on to say: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In its Q3 2013 &lt;a href=&quot;http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/NFLX/2822396166x0x698481/ecfe1ab4-66f5-4e23-a64a-1ca025216e5e/Q313%20Earnings%20Letter%2010.21.13%2010.30am.pdf&quot;&gt;letter to shareholders&lt;/a&gt;, Netflix noted that original shows see “more viewing in the early months” after they first premiere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems that their numbers drop once people are done binging on a particular show. I know of many who only renew their subscription while they watch a new series,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which can’t be good for Netflix financially. We’ll find out whether this is just an experiment, or their new strategy &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/12/house-of-cards-returns-in-february/&quot;&gt;come February&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;These jerks better not ruin it for the rest of us. It’s $8 people. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Are there any shockers in the top searches of 2013? What may come as no surprise to some people is that Miley Cyrus takes the top spot, followed by Kim Kardashian, and American model Kate Upton. Minecraft and Apple’s iPhone 5 are the only two technology-related queries to make it into the top 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shocking&lt;/em&gt;. It should be cause of concern that in the top ten searches on Yahoo, only &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of them is a current news item that people should be well informed on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The theatrical release of Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues is only weeks away, and the promotion campaign for the film is only getting wilder. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/25/5143208/anchorman-2-targets-the-social-web-with-more-than-50-short-videos&quot;&gt;After starring in 50 short clips where Ron Burgundy reads news from around the world&lt;/a&gt;, Will Ferrell co-anchored a live news broadcast in North Dakota last night, staying in character the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hilarious. The way they’ve promoted this film is absolute genius, and I can’t wait to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Amazon.com plans to deliver packages to customers using unmanned aerial vehicles in 30 minutes or less.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“It looks like science fiction, but it’s real,” Amazon said on its website. Its Prime Air service, powered by drones, will be ready from a technology point of view to enter commercial operations as soon as the necessary regulations are in place, it said. The company’s research and development team is already working on the new delivery method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know whether I should be enthused or panicked by this story. I think the answer is both.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One of the many beauties of working with Sass is how easy it is to get organized. In the past, importing different CSS files wasn’t good practice and in fact made for more HTTP requests. With Sass, you can have many different partials which allow you to isolate styles in a logical way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so excited about my first post for the &lt;em&gt;A List Apart&lt;/em&gt; blog! It’s a quick post on using partials to get organized with Sass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To promote the upcoming X-men: Days of Future Past, a new viral site takes the 50th anniversary of JFK’s murder and spins a new conspiracy theory out of the historic tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some will say this is wrong, but it’s quite an interesting twist on actual history, and an intriguing way to promote a movie.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Kobe Bryant signed a two-year contract extension with the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Lakers did not announce financial terms, but a source told ESPNLosAngeles.com’s Ramona Shelburne that the deal is worth $48.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as a huge Laker fan, I don’t see the logic behind this decision. Kobe Bryant has been one of the best players of the current era, but I certainly thought this would be his last year. As great as he is, age eventually catches up with you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I could be terribly wrong. They don’t call him the Black Mamba for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Should we really be dropping buttons, even if it negatively affects intuitive interaction patterns or confuses people with cognitive disabilities? Should we really be using thin type to look “modern” at the risk of decreasing legibility? And tell me, should we really be dropping textures and reducing contrast because it’s the “stylish” thing to do this week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geri makes some amazing points, and then drops the mic. Such a great read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Twitter is testing a new website design, which opts for a lighter, flat design that seems at least partly inspired by its shift to similar design trends on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks terrible. It lacks the polish it should have. The type continues to feel tight, and the fact that they’re going “flat”, is disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…the reality is that Sass (and other CSS preprocessors) can be a powerful ally—a tool that any style-crafter can easily insert into their daily work. It took me a while to come around, but I’m sure glad that I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We published a great excerpt from Dan’s new book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abookapart.com/products/sass-for-web-designers&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sass for Web Designers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Dan has been long regarded as one of the best when it comes to CSS, and I can’t wait to finish reading this new book. If you’re on the fence about whether to buy the book, this great excerpt might be just the thing to whet your appetite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.executionists.com/blog/website-design/cost-to-build-websites-2013/&quot;&gt;According to recent research&lt;/a&gt;, the average small business owner can expect to pay somewhere between $100 and $200 for stock images for their website. Of course, for the owner going through a professional designer, this is just part of a larger number. If you’re a designer, you should always be looking for ways to bring down the final cost of a website. Outbidding the competition isn’t the only factor when it comes to success, but cutting costs where possible certainly won’t hurt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been looking for a way to bring down your stock image costs and increase your bottom line, a new website may be able to help. It’s called Lootback.com, and it functions as a stock image search engine. The site partners with some of the biggest names in the stock photo industry, including iStock, ShutterStock, Graphicriver, Themeforest, and more. The premise is simple: they get a commission on every photo you buy through their site and then split that commission with you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://syndicateads.net/s/uj&quot;&gt;Lootback&lt;/a&gt; provides users with a compilation image search engine. You type in whichever keywords fit your needs and it will come back with results from their industry partners. Helpfully, once you’ve created an account, Lootback will tell you right away how much you will save on a particular image once you’ve clicked on it. Rebates are paid into your account within 12 hours. That said, Lootback only pays out 4 times a year, so don’t expect cash back right away. Still, if you’re a designer who buys hundreds of images a year, the savings could prove substantial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of websites out there that promise to save the average shopper some money, but very few are dedicated to helping out web designers. Lootback aims to save designers time and money and they do a pretty good job of it. If you’ve been in search of a way to bring down your costs, &lt;a href=&quot;http://syndicateads.net/s/uj&quot;&gt;Lootback&lt;/a&gt; is a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Marvel is creating four live-action superhero series and an Avengers-style special event that will all air exclusively on Netflix, beginning in 2015. The first of the TV series will focus on Daredevil, while the following series will star Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix does it again. Can’t wait to see this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today was always going to be a momentous day for BlackBerry, with a looming deadline for its proposed takeover deal with Fairfax Financial Holdings. As it turns out, the full takeover isn’t taking place, but the company is going to receive an investment of $1 billion from Fairfax and a group of other institutional investors as it seeks to steer a new course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What? I mean, it’s tough to feel bad for a company that just received a billion dollars, but what are they doing? BlackBerry is holding on for dear life, and I have to wonder whether this can turn things around for them. I hope for the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Twitter is strong in Japan (as &lt;a href=&quot;http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2011/02/02/why-twitter-outguns-facebook-in-japan/&quot;&gt;we noted back in 2011&lt;/a&gt;) where it’s used by one-third of the Internet population — but the country accounts for under 10 percent of its global revenue and one ad exec told WSJ that many Japanese brands “don’t think Twitter is something to pay money for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular post is interesting to me. Twitter is facing challenges &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;. Why is it news that advertisers don’t want to pay in these specific places?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, I really do admire these new ways of generating revenue that they’re trying. Partnering with TV, although I originally didn’t understand it, makes a lot of sense, and is one alternative to the advertising route that so many seem to just default to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Things have gotten out of hand. Tech writers are given far too much freedom to perpetuate inaccuracies and falsehoods, as well as a generous helping of incompetence these days. That’s why it’s time to put a bit of structure in place for those publications that don’t understand good work from bad work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting read. Although &lt;em&gt;The Bold Report&lt;/em&gt; isn’t incredibly popular yet, I’ve always tried to hold myself to the rules of proper journalism. I &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; want to contribute to the assumption that online writers are an unprofessional bunch.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2013/10/important-customer-security-announcement.html&quot;&gt;Adobe announced the breach on October 3&lt;/a&gt;, it said that attackers stole user names and encrypted passwords for an undisclosed numbers of users, along with encrypted credit or debit card numbers and expiration dates for 2.9 million customers. &lt;a href=&quot;http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/10/adobe-breach-impacted-at-least-38-million-users/&quot;&gt;Krebs on Security now reports&lt;/a&gt; on the full extent of the attack, confirming the 38 million figure with Adobe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow. 2.9 million was already a huge number, but now thirty-eight million? I’m keeping a close watch on my card to see if it’s being used, and I’d recommend you do the same. Also, if you were using the same password in multiple places, it might be a good time to look into 1Password. At this point, the probability of your information &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; being involved in this attack is low.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Being micromanaged by robots is no better than by humans. This kind of stats-obsessed moronity breeds a toxic workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t agree more. Although this product might have been created with great intentions, I can easily see it being abused. If people work for you, ask them to update you. Don’t spy on them, even if under the guise of “avoiding shoulder taps.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Apple on Monday reported its fourth quarter results, posting revenue of $37.5 billion and a profit of $7.5 billion. This compares to revenue of $36 billion and net profit of $8.2 billion in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love Apple, but the amount of success they have is sickening at times. This is a stupid amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Something felt a bit off about this week’s Apple event.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Part of it was the lack of surprises, which isn’t Apple’s fault. All of the product upgrades, while nice, were incremental and predictable. None of the pricing was a surprise. In fact, the only unexpected product announcement is the zombie iPad 2 sticking around for another year, shamelessly at the same price as last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree. It felt weird, and ended abruptly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While I admire all the hard work that went in creating this new version of Tweetbot, I can’t help be a little disappointed. The app has lost much of its personality; both visually and sonically. The new app has some very well done animations, but unfortunately looks too “default iOS 7” for my taste. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I did purchase because I respect the work of Tapbots very much and I want to support them. They have the reputation of making incredible things, and I look forward to seeing the betterment of Tweetbot.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Does the Web Industry Have a Drinking Problem?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Rachel Andrew writing on &lt;em&gt;A List Apart&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Almost every conference’s second day opens with attendees being asked how their hangovers are. Second day early-slot speakers joke that no one will turn up anyway, or they’ll all just be staring into their coffee. It has become normal, in fact expected, that drinking and staying out late is what we do while at conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Rachel brings up a very real issue with our conferences and events. Because our industry is very friendly, and social, it seems we might be blurring the lines of professional time and social time, a bit too much. She goes on to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’re also underlining that our events are for over-18s, maybe even over-21s, by holding them in licensed premises. Most of us know students or even those who are working professionally in our field long before they are “adult.” Should they be excluded?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy having drinks—and the article isn’t advocating for the banishment of alcohol—but I remember being the seventeen year-old kid that couldn’t drink. I’ve always been very extroverted, so it never stopped me from talking to people. However, I can see how it could affect others; making them feel excluded and not part of the group, and Rachel’s article does a great job of shining light on that fact.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Fined $340,000 in Taiwan for Fake Online Comments</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After being caught paying for false praise and negative comments about competitors, Samsung has been fined just over $340,000. The issue first arose internationally in April, when Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission (FTC) announced it was opening an investigation into the allegations. That investigation found the allegations were true: the FTC says Samsung used a “large number of hired writers and designated employees” to post in Taiwanese forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embarrassing. But wait! There’s more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While Samsung is by no means the first company to engage in astroturfing, it’s been caught in the act twice this year alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only are they engaging in unethical marketing practices—which hilariously enough has an official term—they’ve been caught doing it &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; in the same year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get your stuff together, Samsung. You’re better than this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Surface and Surface 2 both include Office, the world’s most popular, most powerful productivity software for free and are priced below both the iPad 2 and iPad Air respectively. Making Apple’s decision to build the price of their less popular and less powerful iWork into their tablets not a very big (or very good) deal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I think they, like others, are waking up to the fact that we’ve built a better solution for people everywhere, who are getting things done from anywhere, and who don’t have hard lines between their personal and professional lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft looks incredibly stupid for publishing this garbage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who cares that you made a device you think “is the most productive tablet you can buy today,” when it’s not selling? Eighty-one percent of tablet usage is on the iPad, and I highly doubt that the Surface has a significant share of the remaining nineteen percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has so much untapped potential they could use for making great new products. Instead, they waste their time writing a post like this that claims they understand “how people work better than anyone else.” Talk is cheap, but the fact is this: while Microsoft was busy loosing $900 million on Surface tablets in Q3 2013, Apple sold 14.6 million iPads.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A month ago today, I launched &lt;em&gt;The Bold Report&lt;/em&gt;. I’m so glad I did it, and we’ve had some pretty great growth in our first month!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, if you’re reading this, I want to say thank you. This site is something I’ve been wanting to do for a long time. I love writing about my interests, and I love the fact that there are people like you, who have similar passions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;now-for-some-stats&quot;&gt;Now for Some Stats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site has been viewed 5,013 times, and people stay an average of two minutes. The site had 3,006 visitors, 1,313 of which were returning. 1,902 visitors are from the United States, the United Kingdom came in second place with 399.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, the two most common mobile devices the site is viewed on, are iOS devices. Coming in first place: iPhone with sixty-two percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chrome was the popular browser, responsible for fifty-six percent of traffic. Nine people visited from Internet Explorer.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Most visitors are using a Mac, but twelve percent is on Windows.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number one source of referrals was Twitter with 1,560, my personal site in third place, and Sidebar.io coming in fourth. The main RSS feed currently has twelve subscribers, and the Twitter account has sixty-six followers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;top-five-posts&quot;&gt;Top Five Posts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first month, these were the top posts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;giveaway&quot;&gt;Giveaway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a token of my appreciation, I wanted to give away two &lt;a href=&quot;https://tonx.org/&quot;&gt;“The Standard” Tonx Coffee Subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll personally pay for your first month, which includes two shipments of great-tasting coffee. My pal Jory Raphael is also kindly giving away two of his amazing &lt;a href=&quot;http://symbolicons.com/&quot;&gt;Symbolicons icon bundles&lt;/a&gt;! The winners will be choosen at random on Friday at 1pm Central. Here’s what you have to do to win:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Mention @theboldreport, and tell me what you like about the site, and what I could possibly do better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The bones haven’t changed all that much over the last 13 years, but every time Apple updates OS X, it continues to improve and refine features and the underlying technologies that make them possible.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;…I firmly believe that OS X is the best consumer desktop operating system on the planet. It has undergone some major changes over the years, but it’s the same OS under the hood. OS X is still as stable, powerful and resilient to viruses and other malware as it has always been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen is one of my favorite writers, and he’s published an amazing, in-depth review of the latest OS X. &lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apple Event Days are always exciting for me, and this one will be no different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be able to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/apple-events/october-2013/&quot;&gt;watch the event live&lt;/a&gt; on your iOS device, Mac, or Apple TV. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; During the event, I’ll be in the &lt;em&gt;#ssktn&lt;/em&gt; iRC chatroom, as a kind of virtual-viewing party. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the event, Chris Enns, Kyle Roderick, and myself will be talking about the event and new gadgets on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ssktn.com/live/&quot;&gt;SSKTN live stream&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Apple Event Day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’m so glad they’ve started to stream most of these events on the Apple TV. It seems that the only one they’re not streaming live these days is WWDC, which is totally understandable. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What Quarkslab’s research proves […] is that Apple’s iMessage back-end &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be designed to allow for Apple to intercept and read message content, and there is no way we, as iMessage users, would be able to detect it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What Apple has said, and reiterated today, is that iMessage’s back-end is not in fact designed in that way — that there is no mechanism in the system for Apple employees to surreptitiously change the encryption key to allow for messages to be decrypted during transit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have much to add to this one, I just found the article to be interesting. I agree with Gruber that it would be a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; mistake for Apple to lie about something as sensitive as this. &lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt;, at the end of the day, which side does it make more sense for companies to side with? Users? That’s naive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix Likely to Have Overtaken HBO in Paid US Subscribers</title>
    <published>2013-10-21T12:19:57-05:00</published>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Amar Toor reporting for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to analysis from Needham &amp;amp; Co., it’s likely that Netflix’s paid US subscriber base reached 30 million by the end of September. That may be enough to overtake HBO, which has an estimated 28.7 million subscribers in the US…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In its fiscal &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/22/4545446/netflix-q2-2013-earnings&quot;&gt;Q2 earnings report&lt;/a&gt; this year, Netflix said it had more than 29 million US subscribers and expected to add between 230,000 and 880,000 in Q3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix is one of those companies that I love to root for. However, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/21/4861624/netflix-has-likely-overtaken-hbo-in-paid-us-subscribers-analysts-say#192210067&quot;&gt;someone in the comments for this article pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, the fact that Netflix has more subscribers than HBO, doesn’t mean they’re making more money. Still, these numbers might just give HBO the scare they need, to consider an online subscription that isn’t tied to any cable company. With Time Warner Cable being the parent company of HBO, I see this as a small probability, but there’s no way they don’t see the potential business they’re missing out on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing is for sure, the competition between these two channels will be interesting to watch. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Freelancing and Saying “No”</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;No. That word has been given lots of importance in our industry and rightly so. &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/53155584&quot;&gt;Jason Santa Maria spoke about it&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/23ad80bdfbc&quot;&gt;Julie Zhuo wrote about it&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m sure you’ve read your fair share of articles on the topic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a powerful word, and I’m glad that we’re a community that looks out for each other and is willing to share with newcomers how to avoid bad projects. There are some relationships that will rob you of your joy, and in the end cost you more money than you’re being paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I think it’s been given a misleading reputation. Lots of people confuse saying no,with turning down projects they don’t deem as “fun”. In some articles, I’ve seen it turn into advice that only strokes the growing ego that many designers have. We turn something great, into snobbery and haughtiness. Consequently, people are given the wrong impression of what saying no actually means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tim-my-business-is-already-struggling-and-you-expect-me-to-say-no-to-a-project&quot;&gt;“Tim, my business is already struggling and you expect me to say no to a project?”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course not. I always take projects that help keep the lights on. Everyone does. If they say they don’t, they’re lying. Not every single project will meet all of your requirements &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and even the ones that do will have difficulties and moments of frustration. That’s just a fact of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying no means to turn down projects that will kill you or your business. You know exactly what I’m talking about. The client that you’re having a preliminary meeting with, and your gut tells you that you shouldn’t work with the person. The reason could be one of many. They don’t know what they want, they want to pay you considerably less, they’re condescending, whatever. That’s when you say no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that someone with a low budget isn’t always a red flag. Learn to trust your gut. You’ll know when it’s a good idea to work for less money, and when it’s just someone that’s trying to take advantage. If you still don’t know, ask a friend. Don’t have someone to ask? Email me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-i-need-the-money&quot;&gt;“But I need the money!”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You think you’re poor now? Just wait till you’re working an insane amount of hours on an insane budget. What happens when you finally get sick of it? Do you fire the client? Will you have to issue a refund? How do you pay for that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust me, something else will come up. I’ve been hours away from having no money in the bank with no prospects of money, and something has always come up.In all honesty, it’s better to pick up a shift at Starbucks, than work in a toxic relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;im-freelancing-so-i-can-have-fun&quot;&gt;“I’m freelancing so I can have fun.”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freelancing is work. There are a lot of hardships. Lots of anxiety. Lots of stress. Maybe even playing “credit card shuffle”. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Not every day is going to be fun, and that’s something you have to come to terms with. However, it’s also very rewarding. I wake up when I want, I work when I want, I get to choose my clients,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I can choose to collaborate with other designers, developers, etc., and I can work from wherever there is internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll land three projects one month, and have no work the next.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Money management becomes crucial when you freelance. But, don’t worry. If I can do it—and I’m literally the best blower of money—you can definitely do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wrapping-up&quot;&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All projects aren’t going to be fun, and they won’t all be big brands or names. Learn to appreciate projects that allow you to work with people who care, make an impact on peoples lives, and teach you new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all clients are bad. Most are well-meaning people who are trying to do their best by their business or company. Saying no, should never satisfy an emotional need to rebel. Instead, it should be educated by the goals of your business, and that of the client. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing, remember that the objective of saying no, will give you the opportunity to say yes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You’re the one that decides what those requirements are. For me, I have an internal checklist. Is the project fun? Do I believe in the message of the project and the company trying to communicate it? Does the client show respect for me, my work, and my time? Who else will I be working with? What will I learn? Will I be able to display the work in my portfolio? Do I have time? Is the budget reasonable? &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is when you pay one card with another card. Or you’re paying bills with a credit card. It’s scary stuff. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is true whether you have clients are not. You’re &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; forced to work on something you don’t want to. Even if the work is horrible, it was &lt;em&gt;my choice&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;July was killer. September was dry. Feast or famine. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A huge part of making art online and growing an audience is centered around how often you show up, how good you are at what you do, and how narrow your focus is and how “&lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/2009/03/obsession_times_voice&quot;&gt;weirdly obsessed&lt;/a&gt;” you are about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fitbit CEO James Park said the company is “inching closer and closer to being a smartwatch.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Park also emphasized that Fitbit is vertically focused on the health and fitness space, so it’s not worried about smartwatches that are rumored to be coming from Apple and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s very smart of Fitbit, because they have no chance in competing with Google or Apple, if these rumors are true. For some, a “smartwatch”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; will be overkill for tracking their health and fitness. However, if their products serve the niche market well, they have the opportunity to continue being very successful in the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Is that really the term we’ve settled on? &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The most conscious decision I made about openness was to not put up a front and not always try to make myself look better. We all do things that make us look stupid from time to time (I do it a lot!). But what’s really wrong with looking stupid? Why would I want to pretend to be superhuman? That would just set unrealistic expectations for my clients and everybody else around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laura is one of my favorite people. She’s real, she’s humble, and crazy talented. That combination of qualities have made her the success she is. In her column today, on &lt;em&gt;A List Apart&lt;/em&gt;, she does a great job explaining why being open and transparent is a very good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To use Square Cash, all you do is compose an email to a friend, type the amount you way to pay in the subject title, and cc cash@square.com. If it’s your first time using the service, you’re directed to Square’s website where you type in your debit card number — and you’re done. There are no accounts to create, apps to download, friends to add, surcharges to pay, or bank account numbers to look up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is amazing. My only question is: why has this taken so long? It seems that this could’ve existed years ago. Good on Square for continuing to do great things.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If anyone thinks MediaTemple is just going to be exactly the same or better forever, I’ll bet you a nickel you’re wrong. I bet they are losing employees as we speak who aren’t happy about this. Things will change. I am going to give them the benefit of the doubt though. I’m going to keep on liking both services until there is a real reason to not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Compared to the similarly priced Jambox, the Play:1 is considerably louder, crisper, and more present. The more expensive Big Jambox offers a wider range and better separation than a single Play:1 thanks to its larger speakers and configuration. But the Play:1 is still louder and sounds bigger, if slightly more muddled because of the lack of speaker separation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really excited about this news. Since receiving my new iPhone, I now need to replace by bathroom speaker because it uses the old 30-pin connector. I started thinking that it would be better to buy things that are connector-independent, this way, it’ll last me longer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d looked at several speakers, and had heard very good things of all the Sonos speakers and &lt;a href=&quot;https://jawbone.com/speakers/bigjambox&quot;&gt;Big Jambox&lt;/a&gt;, but was worried to go Sonos because of the high price point. This new speaker is more wallet friendly, and could be the start of a great relationship with the Sonos ecosystem. I’ll write some thoughts on the speaker once I receive and use it for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Minor’ Upgrade to Instagram No Longer Lets Users Disable Video Autoplay</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jon Russell reporting for &lt;em&gt;The Next Web&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Instagram announced earlier this month that it will begin serving in-feed advertising before the end of the year, and the Facebook-owned photo and video app has made a subtle, but important, change after it removed the option to switch off autoplay for videos on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what to say. Do I like that Instagram is about to be Facebook-ized? No. But, the fact of the matter is, that they weren’t profitable, and now they have to be. Is there a better way? Maybe. But what is it? I have no idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I do know: I hate quotes like this, where Instagram says they want “these ads to be enjoyable and creative in much the same way you see engaging, high-quality ads when you flip through your favorite magazine.” Guess what? Everyone, &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;, flips right past them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, what are they supposed to do? If they offered some type of subscription, it wouldn’t make enough to sustain the business. If they &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; allowed paying customers, they’d loose their core user base of adolescents and young adults. They could offer filters as an in-app purchase, &lt;a href=&quot;http://favd.net/&quot;&gt;like Favd does&lt;/a&gt;, but I have no idea whether that would make enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as much as it bothers me that they’ve gone the advertising route, I can’t help but empathize. I myself put ads on this site, and on my podcast. It’s easy, it often pays the bills, and sometimes more. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. said Thursday that it is removing a setting that controls whether users could be found when people type their name into the website’s search bar.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Facebook says only a single-digit percentage of the nearly 1.2 billion people on its network were using the setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is Facebook without their continued unethical behavior involving privacy. And then to say “only a single-digit percentage of the nearly 1.2 billion people on its network” are using it? As &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tubes/status/388505400527450113&quot;&gt;Sean Tubridy pointed out so well&lt;/a&gt;, that’s “between 10 million and 90 million people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Facebook seems to forget, is that what’s bad for users, is bad for business. A lesson they might learn the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Hewlett Packard and Microsoft are changing “from partners to outright competitors,” says HP CEO Meg Whitman…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has made a number of recent decisions contrary to HP’s own interests, including bailing out competitor Dell in an attempt to push Windows 8 to the business sector. Also central to her reclassification is Microsoft’s commitment to Surface, despite previous claims from HP that Surface wasn’t a threat to its own Windows 8 tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all could see this coming. As Microsoft moves to create their own hardware, the companies that have built business around that not being the case, are now in trouble. HP didn’t help itself either, by making &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/2/2533759/slate-2-hp-tries-tablets-again-with-windows-swype-and-a-stylus-for-699&quot;&gt;horrible tablets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article goes on to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Craig Mundie — senior advisor to Microsoft’s CEO — said although Microsoft had planned to leave device design to its partners, “it became hard to guarantee a uniform quality of experience that the end user had.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you’re gettin’ it, Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Bill Nye has collaborated with NASA to launch a new eight-part web series on the agency’s latest mission to Jupiter. The science enthusiast and TV host, who for years entertained kids with the PBS show Bill Nye the Science Guy, first teased a return to presenting back in July…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so excited to see Bill Nye hosting a science show again. When I was in middle school, we often watched his show in science class. I’ve always loved his ability to make science fun and interesting. He clearly has a passion for it, and it shines through.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Google today decided to clarify its stance for small businesses using Google Fiber. In short, small businesses aren’t allowed to take advantage of the ISP, at least not yet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Currently, Google is only bringing Fiber to residential locations (units and homes where people live) as well as the public and nonprofit sites selected by each Fiber city. This means that there is currently a loophole: home-based businesses can use Google Fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why they would make such a seemingly arbitrary rule, doesn’t make sense, and I’m sure will disappoint a lot of local businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is: Will they enforce the policy?&lt;/p&gt;

The focal point of the gathering will be the latest updates to the company’s iPad line, but the new Mac Pro and OS X Mavericks will likely get some stage time as well, I’m told.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As the Web landscape grows increasingly complex, it’s increasingly important to demonstrate the myriad ways a Web experience can be interacted with. It’s impossible for designers working in static environments to realistically articulate every device, user setting, and variable that effects how a design is realized. Because of this, front-end developers need to work closely with other designers to ensure what’s being created is realistic and feasible. This requires rolling front-end development into the design workflow, rethinking our deliverables, and working together in order to create experiences that look and function beautifully on a whole host of screen sizes, form factors, and environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well said. Brad excellently explains why I think the web is so exciting right now. Sure, there will always be people who don’t get it. But, the line between design and front-end development is being blurred, and I love that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’ve looked at several tutorials over the years, but many were written with a certain assumption for the level of knowledge on the other end. Many can be a struggle for the beginner because you may not even have the tools to be able to use Sass. Because of this, I wanted to write a handful of tips on what helped me get on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been on the fence about trying Sass, this is a really good place to start. I promise you, &lt;em&gt;I promise you&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll never go back to normal CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This week, a Yale law professor took aim at Microsoft’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bingiton.com/&quot;&gt;Bing It On&lt;/a&gt;” campaign…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;http://islandia.law.yale.edu/ayres/BingItOn_Draft%209.pdf&quot;&gt;Ayres’ results differed sharply&lt;/a&gt; from Microsoft’s: “We found that, to the contrary of Microsoft’s claim, 53 percent of subjects preferred Google and 41 percent Bing (6 percent of results were “ties”). This is not even close to the advertised claim that people prefer Bing ‘nearly two-to-one.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is fascinating. Microsoft responded to this professor, but in my opinion, gave a statement that were just words and didn’t explain why this test was so different from the one Microsoft conducted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what happens when you make commercials that call out other brands. Making fun of other people is the low thing to do, and quite honestly, the easy thing to do. Tell us how Bing is &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; better Microsoft, or shut up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://agilebits.com/onepassword&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; is one of my favorite apps. The amount of time it has saved me is unmeasurable, and it’s made my password strategy secure and delightful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don’t know about 1Password, it’s a great utility app to store and generate passwords. For years, I was the person who had &lt;em&gt;the same password for everything&lt;/em&gt;. With 1Password, I don’t do that anymore, I’m able to search through weak passwords and generate stronger ones, making it less likely to get hacked. Even if that does happen, none of my passwords are the same, so I only need to reset the one that’s been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-impressions&quot;&gt;First Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new interface is beautiful, and obviously influenced by the iOS version.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Chrome extension got a facelift, and generated passwords are not only filled in forms, they’re also copied to your clipboard.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1Password Mini brings most of the power of the main app to the menubar. This is great for entering passwords into apps that aren’t the browser. I disliked having to open the main app to do this in previous versions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-features-in-1password-4-for-mac&quot;&gt;New Features in 1Password 4 for Mac&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you’ll notice when you open the new 1Password is the beautiful interface. If you’ve already purchased &lt;a href=&quot;https://agilebits.com/onepassword/ios&quot;&gt;the latest iOS app&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll notice that the new design is very similar, which delights me greatly. This redesign is years overdue, and the AgileBits team has delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://theboldreport.net/uploads/2013/10/1p4-mac-main.png&quot; alt=&quot;1Password 4 for Mac main view&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love that this redesign in a lot of ways is a re-align. The interface remains in the three column layout, yet with an easy-on-the-eyes, light background. The type has greatly improved, and the middle column no longer has the “shelf” look. The new layout, allows you to see more logins in the window without having to scroll and sports better looking icons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the last column has been redone too. It used to be confusing to look at, and honestly, I didn’t know what was going on. It’s now a lot more simplified and only displays necessary information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, my favorite part of the main view, is the new “Security Audit” that appears in the far left column. It gives you easy access to weak passwords, duplicate passwords, and passwords that are old and might need to be changed. To be clear, this type of filtering has always been present in 1Password, but the fact that it’s now front and center, is very valuable to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;multiple-vaults&quot;&gt;Multiple Vaults&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One feature that I can see becoming very popular is the new feature of multiple vaults. I haven’t actually been using this feature, but it’s one of those things that I think could help me organize the different sets of passwords. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially true when I worked for a company. Having a separate vault exclusively for company logins, would’ve been a great way to get organized. This makes managing items easier, and makes cleaning out items you no longer need, a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://theboldreport.net/uploads/2013/10/1p4-mac-create-new-vault.png&quot; alt=&quot;Create a new vault&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;password-mini&quot;&gt;1Password Mini&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love that they made a menubar app. I’m definitely one of those people that has &lt;em&gt;way too many&lt;/em&gt; of them.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Interestingly, the menubar app is what comes up now when you press &lt;code&gt;⌘CMD + \&lt;/code&gt;. It seems that the 1Password browser extension is now only needed to run the code necessary for the autofill. You’ll never actually need to press the button anymore, which is nice, because it’s one less button in the extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://theboldreport.net/uploads/2013/10/1p4-mac-1p-mini-item-details.png&quot; alt=&quot;1Password Mini details&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s too early for me to say, but I think 1Password Mini could completely replace the main app for me. So far, I haven’t needed to open the main app for day-to-day responsibilities. To be honest, I only looked at the main app the day I downloaded it, and today when writing this review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-features-you-should-know-about&quot;&gt;Other Features You Should Know About&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Items&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;
Till now, I haven’t needed to ever share login items, but I can definitely see the practicality of this. You can share items with email or iMessage, and if the person makes changes, the item automatically updates when shared back.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;256-bit Authenticated Encryption&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;
I have no idea what this means, except that 1Password is constantly being updated to be more and more secure. From what I’m told, this prevents attacks that don’t even exist yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wifi Sync&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;
This feature is back from previous versions. Personally, I use Dropbox to sync my Vault between my Mac, iPad and iPhone, but whatever floats your boat. They have iCloud sync too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AgileBits team have definitely outdone themselves. Not only is this update to 1Password beautiful, the new features and menubar app, make the upgrade very worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never used 1Password, this is a perfect time to purchase. In this day and age, it’s crucial to have secure passwords. This is an app you’ll later wonder how you did without.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems you can’t currently purchase the new 1Password from &lt;a href=&quot;https://agilebits.com/store&quot;&gt;the AgileBits store&lt;/a&gt;, but that is where it’ll be very soon.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; You can also purchase from &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password/id443987910?mt=12&quot;&gt;the Mac App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; You can now purchase and/or upgrade on &lt;a href=&quot;https://agilebits.com/store&quot;&gt;the AgileBits store&lt;/a&gt;. Seems my speculation was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;further-reading&quot;&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.agilebits.com/2013/08/31/how-long-should-my-passwords-be/&quot;&gt;How long should my passwords be?&lt;/a&gt; - If you’re interested in making generated passwords from 1Password very secure, I definitely recommend this article by the AgileBits team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This might seem like a small thing, but it’s one of my favorite additions to 1Password. I used to copy the password then press the fill button, and now those two actions are done with one press. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;By the way, you can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macbartender.com/&quot;&gt;Bartender&lt;/a&gt; to clean that menubar up.  &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is only speculation, but I wonder if they’re required to give the App Store preference for a set amount of time. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We all have our moments when we feel down. In my case, the past two years have been full of personal mistakes and bad decisions. Failure is difficult to accept. Yet, these things considered, it’s not the end; the book has not yet been finished, even when at times, it certainly feels like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although, anyone would’ve considered me an optimist a year ago, it’s not so easy in practice. Yet, something I’ve forced myself to do, is always remember I have reasons to be grateful. I think it’s a good idea to do this whether you’re going through a tough time or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in a very privileged part of the world, and I often get wrapped up in my own problems, client frustrations, and whining about stupidities, that I forget how much worse it could really be. My alarm in the morning could be a bomb, instead of my cute cat, and I could be in a perpetual state of worry. There are people going through much worse than I’ve &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; gone through, and that empathy allows me to step back and look at my life objectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My life isn’t perfect. I don’t make nearly as much money as I’d like, I’ve been a disappointment to people who care about me, I have debt that is far away from being paid off, I’m overweight, and I’ve hurt a girl I was in love with, twice… twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, I have parents, family and friends that love me, and add meaning to my life. I’m healthy. I haven’t gone hungry. I work in an amazing industry, where I can say I love my job. And I live in a beautiful place that enjoys the four amazing seasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happiness and contentment are a choice, and I &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; to be happy, I &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; to be grateful for what I have, I &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; to make lemonade out of lemons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I pour you a glass?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was originally written for &lt;a href=&quot;http://the-pastry-box-project.net/&quot;&gt;The Pastry Box&lt;/a&gt;. They have so many people wanting to contribute, that they weren’t able to accept my submission.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Using Portly for Local Development</title>
    <published>2013-10-02T09:52:41-05:00</published>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My friend, &lt;a href=&quot;http://adamstacoviak.com/&quot;&gt;Adam Stacoviak&lt;/a&gt;, pointed me to a tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://getportly.com/&quot;&gt;Portly&lt;/a&gt;. Portly allows you to display your local web server, publicly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the Portly site, you can tell that the applications of this menubar app, are many. I’ve been using it to do local device testing without the need for a staging server. This a very basic usage of this powerful app, but it’s been a huge timesaver for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; develop sites locally.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; One problem I constantly ran into, is that I wasn’t able to easily test sites on my different devices. Sure, you can use a bookmarklet, resize your browser, or sign up for something like BrowserStack, but I like to test from the comfort of my couch.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2013/10/portly-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Portly Preferences&quot; title=&quot;Portly Preferences&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where Portly comes in. I simply add a tunnel in the app, point it to my local connection string,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; turn on the tunnel,  and go to the subdomain on my iPad or iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I know there are other ways to do this, but I just wasn’t nerdy enough to implement them. Portly is easy, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://getportly.com/plans&quot;&gt;starting at $2.99/month&lt;/a&gt;, a very good deal. You should definitely check it out. If you need help or have questions, ping me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ttimsmith&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#116;&amp;#105;&amp;#109;&amp;#064;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#101;&amp;#098;&amp;#111;&amp;#108;&amp;#100;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#112;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#046;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&quot;&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you’re working on a live server, stop that. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’ve found that QA is much more enjoyable—and effective—when I’m relaxed and comfortable. I turn on the TV for background noise, sit back on the couch, and browse every single page of the site. I find things I need to fix and assign myself GitHub issues. This ritual is often accompanied by a cup of coffee as well. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000&quot;&gt;http://localhost:4000&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thethemefoundry.com/&quot;&gt;The Theme Foundry&lt;/a&gt; has been building premium WordPress themes since 2008. They recently released Collections – a unique and beautiful WordPress theme for sharing, designed by Veerle Pieters. Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://demo.thethemefoundry.com/collections-theme/&quot;&gt;live demo of Collections&lt;/a&gt; to see it in action, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://thethemefoundry.com/wordpress/collections/&quot;&gt;purchase it now for $79&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes The Theme Foundry special?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A focus on quality over quantity.&lt;/strong&gt; You won’t find a huge assortment on their site – they keep a small, curated collection of &lt;a href=&quot;http://thethemefoundry.com/wordpress/&quot;&gt;premium WordPress themes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exclusive partner with WordPress.com&lt;/strong&gt; (the official hosted WordPress provider). Each and every theme goes through a stringent audit process from some of the best WordPress coders in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole team support.&lt;/strong&gt; You get fast and friendly support from the team that &lt;em&gt;actually built&lt;/em&gt; your theme, not a part time support rep.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://syndicateads.net/s/sl&quot;&gt;The Theme Foundry&lt;/a&gt; for supporting The Bold Report this week. They’re awesome people.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The peo­ple who scoff at App​.net and won­der “why do we need another Twit­ter?” are missing the point. Actu­ally, they’re miss­ing the point of the inter­net. There’s plenty of room for another social net­work. You don’t have to use it but that doesn’t make it invalid. For every per­son that makes fun of Google+, there’s another 5 peo­ple get­ting a lot of com­mu­nity and fun out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this article is talking about Favd, yet almost accidentally, he describes what I think is a very convincing argument for App.net’s relevance. Chris goes on to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And while Favd might look like “yet another Insta­gram clone”, it’s tak­ing the parts of Insta­gram that peo­ple enjoy — tak­ing and shar­ing pho­tos with friends online — and leav­ing behind the cor­po­rate shadi­ness that comes with being asso­ci­ated with Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris effectively points out, that just when we think a market has been saturated beyond belief, there’s always someone who can approach a problem a bit smarter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Becomes ‘Most Valuable Brand’ of 2013</title>

  &lt;p&gt;Apple has taken the top spot as 2013′s Most Valuable Brand, ending Coca-Cola’s 13 year streak as number one in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.interbrand.com/en/best-global-brands/2013/Best-Global-Brands-2013-Brand-View.aspx&quot;&gt;annual Best Global Brands report&lt;/a&gt; compiled by Interbrand. Coca-Cola ended up third, surpassed by both Apple and Google this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is pretty big news. A company’s brand is based a lot on public perception, and for Apple and Google to surpass Coca-Cola, which in my opinion is the one of the best brands ever created,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is quite the compliment on how they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You know you agree with that. Whether you’re a Coke lover, or Pepsi lover (Oh god, can I footnote the footnote?), Coca-Cola has been advertising it’s drink with bears… bears. If you can advertise your product without taking cheap shots at your competitor, you’re doing well. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, I see a tool like this from Google, and my whole opinion changes. I had some pretty harsh things to say about Macaw.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google—in many ways—is the reason I do my job the way I do it. They’re advocates for building the web well, and fast. It’s hard for me to believe they’ll make a tool that does the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I don’t know what happened to the tweet. But, I basically said that Macaw holds designers back from doing what they should do: learn to code. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Once I discovered the best times I like to work as a freelancer, I realized, why would I want to be working past that anyways? I love my job but I also love doing things outside my job. These things bring me great happiness and satisfaction, in turn, giving me the motivation and passion needed to perform effectively at my job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love when people write about how working long hours is not a good idea. I love it when someone like Janna Hagan—whom I admire very much—does it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, have a great weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Something I’ve been thinking about a lot recently is documentation. And yes, I’m thinking a little bit about legacy—documenting our life, and the things we make. However, I also mean documenting our process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of mystery surrounding what we do. I remember being a newcomer and feeling overwhelmed by everything it seemed that I needed to learn. This is where I think documentation can help us a lot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an industry, we’re getting comfortable with doing things in the open. &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensourcedesign.is/&quot;&gt;Open Source Design&lt;/a&gt; is trying to do this, a project which I happen to be a contributor on, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensourcedesign.is/resourced/&quot;&gt;there are other people doing it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about being open about what we charge for services? What about talking about how much designers should be making in a beginning job? Medium level? Senior level? Should we negotiate for a signing bonus? Do companies still do this? To be very honest, I only learned about some of these things a couple months ago when I had dinner with my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://bermonpainter.com/&quot;&gt;Bermon&lt;/a&gt;. Why is this such a mystery?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a more personal level, what about our process? I have no documentation of my personal design and development process. All of it lives in my head, which quite frankly, isn’t useful for anyone. Pricing projects could be so much simpler if I had a process to run them through. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a lot of ways, I don’t know what I’m doing. Yet, at the same time, I really do. But that knowledge is wasted if I don’t share it with others. Not to mention, there will always be people that can benefit from something I’ve learned. We’re all in different places of our career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past month, I’ve met so many smart people who are saying nothing. They have great ideas, but they don’t tell anyone about them. Then, there are others who are content with believing in mythical gatekeepers that prevent them from having a voice in this industry.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s rubbish.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to have a voice, if you want to contribute, document everything. Tell people about what you’re doing, why you did it that way, and why others should think about doing it the same. We need your voice, but no one is going to beg you to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As cliché as it might sound, anyone has the power to make our industry better, and personally that’s why I love our industry and working in the open. When many minds come together and collaborate and share, the end result is one-hundred times better. When more people share, we have a more diverse group of people to admire, to interview, to invite to speak, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step up. Document everything.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This particularly makes me mad. It’s so high-school drama. If you want to do something, do it. Complaining isn’t productive. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The App Store Problem</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The bottom line is this: developers should be able to work on their product in a sustainable way. Realmac are some of the good guys, and to have to backtrack on a business decision is a damn shame, especially in a world where people pour money into IAP-based games day and night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a real problem. We can obviously see a huge hole in the App Store ecosystem. Honestly, I have no idea if Apple will ever implement upgrade pricing. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imore.com/apple-puts-its-price-tag-where-its-policy-charges-full-price-logic-pro-x-mac-app-store&quot;&gt;Signs point to no&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple desperately needs to examine this problem, and understand that the beautiful ecosystem it’s created, could crumble because of issues like this. And as the person purchasing software, I need to understand that developers &lt;strong&gt;are in their right&lt;/strong&gt; to charge money for new software. I love what &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/382899550341853184&quot;&gt;Marco Arment said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Upset about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realmacsoftware&quot;&gt;@realmacsoftware&lt;/a&gt; asking for another 3 dollars for a big update to Clear and going universal?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You should be ashamed of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you need tons of features or anything I’m choosing not to do, you’ll probably be happier with one of the others. (Before I started using Overcast full-time, Downcast was my podcast app of choice.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’m adding some new stuff that I haven’t seen before in podcast players, and implementing what I think is the best set of core features from the existing apps. It’s my ideal podcast app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I love Marco Arment. It happens to be the reason he’s also very successful. He trusts his gut, which I think is one of the most difficult things to learn how to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marco isn’t given enough credit as a designer. He may not create the visuals for all of his products, but he is very deliberate with his design decisions. Can’t wait for this app.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At 1.4MB, today’s average page is 15 times larger than it was 10 years ago, primarily due to images (881kB) and script (224kB). Plain old HTML totals just 54kB—but when’s the last time you saw an HTML-only site? This average page also makes more than 100 HTTP requests. Whether they fetch a big object or a small one, these add up to more delay and more power wastage. The average site is also slow: Alexa’s top 2,000 retailer sites now take an average of more than seven seconds to load—much longer than users consider acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We published &lt;a href=&quot;http://alistapart.com/issue/383&quot;&gt;a great issue&lt;/a&gt; today, but this particular article written by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jcux.co.uk/&quot;&gt;James Christie&lt;/a&gt; caught my eye. I’ve been doing a lot of research into performance, but I’d stupidly never thought how slow sites can have an impact on our environment. Site performance matters; not only to visitors, but to our planet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Apple’s iPhone 5 is 2.5 times faster at responding to touches than Google Android devices, according to a benchmark test by game and app streaming firm Agawi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t surprise me at all. The level of care and detail Apple spends on this type of stuff is the reason people line up in the rain to get their devices. The article goes on to explain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the iPhone 5 responded to touches at an average time of 55 milliseconds…. The closest Android device was the Samsung Galaxy S4 at 114 milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s almost ridiculous to be examining this at the millisecond level, but tell me you’ve never noticed this delay when borrowing an Android device from a someone.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Those small details matter.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Because you don’t own one do you? &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Netflix made history tonight, winning three Emmy awards for House of Cards, becoming the first company to win the awards for online-only shows. Original shows produced by Netflix had received 14 nominations — 9 of those for House of Cards alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is huge. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Netflix gets it. They’re making entertaining shows, and minimizing piracy. Traditional television hasn’t been able to nail both.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;BlackBerry has officially filed a letter with Canadian holding company Fairfax Financial, an offer that could lead to it returning to private ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be a good thing for them. I remember when BlackBerry was on top, and then fell to the pits of irrelevance. Personally, I hope this helps them get their act together. I believe that the smartphone market will only continue to get better with better competition.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Apple® today announced it has sold a record-breaking nine million new iPhone® 5s and iPhone 5c models, just three days after the launch of the new iPhones on September 20. In addition, more than 200 million iOS devices are now running the completely redesigned iOS 7, making it the fastest software upgrade in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time the worlds says Apple is done, they come and do something like this. It’s also interesting to note that &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57603876-94/samsung-sends-spies-to-uncover-apples-iphone-line-phenom/&quot;&gt;Samsung sent out a film crew to the iPhone lines&lt;/a&gt;. None of the competitors get why people are so passionate about Apple’s products.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to &lt;em&gt;The Bold Report&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been pondering the creation of a blog for quite some time now. In the past few months, I’ve felt that the goals I have for my writing have outgrown my personal site, and it was time to move it to its own home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bold Report&lt;/em&gt; is that new home. If you were a fan of my personal blog, you’ll see most of the same content on here. There will be long form articles which address topics that are on my mind, and links which point you to great content or exciting news around the web. As I have before, the links will have my commentary, which I’ve found that people appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this site &lt;em&gt;is not&lt;/em&gt; to report on breaking news—there are many other sites doing that—rather to inform you of exciting new technology, products you should keep your eye on, or what I happen to be learning at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in fascinating times. The evolution of technology is not only influencing how we design and develop experiences, it is changing the way we interact with others and our surroundings. Whole industries have been re-imagined, and that will only continue to happen. If nothing else, I want this blog to document that, and show my predictions as false or accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my hope that you’ll join me on this journey. You can find the different ways to subscribe on the &lt;a href=&quot;/subscribe/&quot;&gt;subscribe page&lt;/a&gt;. Although there are no comments on this site, please feel free to reach me &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ttimsmith&quot;&gt;via Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or email me at &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#116;&amp;#097;&amp;#099;&amp;#116;&amp;#064;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#101;&amp;#098;&amp;#111;&amp;#108;&amp;#100;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#112;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#046;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&quot;&gt;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#116;&amp;#097;&amp;#099;&amp;#116;&amp;#064;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#101;&amp;#098;&amp;#111;&amp;#108;&amp;#100;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#112;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#046;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading, it means a lot to me.&lt;/p&gt;
