        <p>Ken Yeung on <em>The Next Web</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there any shockers in the top searches of 2013? What may come as no surprise to some people is that Miley Cyrus takes the top spot, followed by Kim Kardashian, and American model Kate Upton. Minecraft and Apple’s iPhone 5 are the only two technology-related queries to make it into the top 10.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Shocking</em>. It should be cause of concern that in the top ten searches on Yahoo, only <strong><em>one</em></strong> of them is a current news item that people should be well informed on. </p>

        <p>My friend, <a href="http://www.rachil.li/">Rachel Shillcock</a>, launched her new podcast called <em>Beyond Ink</em>. She’s a natural in front of the microphone, and does <a href="http://www.beyondink.co.uk/shows/01-laura-and-simon">a great first show with Simon Collison and Laura Kalbag</a>.</p>

<p>She’ll hopefully be on <em>The East Wing</em> later this month to talk more about her new show.</p>

  <p>Amazon.com plans to deliver packages to customers using unmanned aerial vehicles in 30 minutes or less.</p>

  <p>“It looks like science fiction, but it’s real,” Amazon said on its website. Its Prime Air service, powered by drones, will be ready from a technology point of view to enter commercial operations as soon as the necessary regulations are in place, it said. The company’s research and development team is already working on the new delivery method.</p>

<p>I don’t know whether I should be enthused or panicked by this story. I think the answer is both.</p>

  <p>One of the many beauties of working with Sass is how easy it is to get organized. In the past, importing different CSS files wasn’t good practice and in fact made for more HTTP requests. With Sass, you can have many different partials which allow you to isolate styles in a logical way.</p>

<p>I’m so excited about my first post for the <em>A List Apart</em> blog! It’s a quick post on using partials to get organized with Sass.</p>

  <p>The Lakers did not announce financial terms, but a source told ESPNLosAngeles.com’s Ramona Shelburne that the deal is worth $48.5 million.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even as a huge Laker fan, I don’t see the logic behind this decision. Kobe Bryant has been one of the best players of the current era, but I certainly thought this would be his last year. As great as he is, age eventually catches up with you. </p>

<p><strong><em>But</em></strong> I could be terribly wrong. They don’t call him the Black Mamba for nothing.</p>

        <p>Darrell Etherington on <em>TechCrunch</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Twitter is testing a new website design, which opts for a lighter, flat design that seems at least partly inspired by its shift to similar design trends on mobile.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This looks terrible. It lacks the polish it should have. The type continues to feel tight, and the fact that they’re going “flat”, is disappointing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…the reality is that Sass (and other CSS preprocessors) can be a powerful ally—a tool that any style-crafter can easily insert into their daily work. It took me a while to come around, but I’m sure glad that I did.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We published a great excerpt from Dan’s new book <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/sass-for-web-designers"><em>Sass for Web Designers</em></a>. Dan has been long regarded as one of the best when it comes to CSS, and I can’t wait to finish reading this new book. If you’re on the fence about whether to buy the book, this great excerpt might be just the thing to whet your appetite.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.executionists.com/blog/website-design/cost-to-build-websites-2013/">According to recent research</a>, the average small business owner can expect to pay somewhere between $100 and $200 for stock images for their website. Of course, for the owner going through a professional designer, this is just part of a larger number. If you’re a designer, you should always be looking for ways to bring down the final cost of a website. Outbidding the competition isn’t the only factor when it comes to success, but cutting costs where possible certainly won’t hurt. </p>

<p>If you’ve been looking for a way to bring down your stock image costs and increase your bottom line, a new website may be able to help. It’s called Lootback.com, and it functions as a stock image search engine. The site partners with some of the biggest names in the stock photo industry, including iStock, ShutterStock, Graphicriver, Themeforest, and more. The premise is simple: they get a commission on every photo you buy through their site and then split that commission with you. </p>

<p><a href="http://syndicateads.net/s/uj">Lootback</a> provides users with a compilation image search engine. You type in whichever keywords fit your needs and it will come back with results from their industry partners. Helpfully, once you’ve created an account, Lootback will tell you right away how much you will save on a particular image once you’ve clicked on it. Rebates are paid into your account within 12 hours. That said, Lootback only pays out 4 times a year, so don’t expect cash back right away. Still, if you’re a designer who buys hundreds of images a year, the savings could prove substantial.</p>

<p>There are a lot of websites out there that promise to save the average shopper some money, but very few are dedicated to helping out web designers. Lootback aims to save designers time and money and they do a pretty good job of it. If you’ve been in search of a way to bring down your costs, <a href="http://syndicateads.net/s/uj">Lootback</a> is a good place to start.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Marvel is creating four live-action superhero series and an Avengers-style special event that will all air exclusively on Netflix, beginning in 2015. The first of the TV series will focus on Daredevil, while the following series will star Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage.</p>

<p>Netflix does it again. Can’t wait to see this. </p>

        <p>Vlad Savov reporting for <em>The Verge</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today was always going to be a momentous day for BlackBerry, with a looming deadline for its proposed takeover deal with Fairfax Financial Holdings. As it turns out, the full takeover isn’t taking place, but the company is going to receive an investment of $1 billion from Fairfax and a group of other institutional investors as it seeks to steer a new course.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What? I mean, it’s tough to feel bad for a company that just received a billion dollars, but what are they doing? BlackBerry is holding on for dear life, and I have to wonder whether this can turn things around for them. I hope for the best.</p>

        <p>Reported on <em>The Next Web</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Twitter is strong in Japan (as <a href="http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2011/02/02/why-twitter-outguns-facebook-in-japan/">we noted back in 2011</a>) where it’s used by one-third of the Internet population — but the country accounts for under 10 percent of its global revenue and one ad exec told WSJ that many Japanese brands “don’t think Twitter is something to pay money for.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This particular post is interesting to me. Twitter is facing challenges <em>everywhere</em>. Why is it news that advertisers don’t want to pay in these specific places?</p>

<p>With that said, I really do admire these new ways of generating revenue that they’re trying. Partnering with TV, although I originally didn’t understand it, makes a lot of sense, and is one alternative to the advertising route that so many seem to just default to.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Things have gotten out of hand. Tech writers are given far too much freedom to perpetuate inaccuracies and falsehoods, as well as a generous helping of incompetence these days. That’s why it’s time to put a bit of structure in place for those publications that don’t understand good work from bad work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an interesting read. Although <em>The Bold Report</em> isn’t incredibly popular yet, I’ve always tried to hold myself to the rules of proper journalism. I <strong><em>do not</em></strong> want to contribute to the assumption that online writers are an unprofessional bunch.</p>
