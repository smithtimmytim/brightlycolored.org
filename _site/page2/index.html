I want to thank <a href="http://5by5.tv/people/dan-benjamin">Dan Benjamin</a> for inviting me to his network, and <a href="http://sensibleworld.com/">Jory Raphael</a> for the gorgeous new artwork.</p>

<p>I’ve been working behind the scenes on this move for some time now, and I’m happy that the show is launched on it’s new home.</p>

<h3 id="listening-live">Listening Live</h3>
<p>The East Wing will now record live at <a href="http://5by5.tv/live">5by5.tv/live</a> every Wednesday at 3pm Central.</p>

<p>5by5 has some pretty awesome apps that you can use to listen as well. There’s the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/5by5-radio/id520847556?mt=8&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=GfpxbBXXpXE-y3gfJGyOQcSr2tOpkzD12A&amp;uo=8&amp;at=11laDR">5by5 Radio app for iOS</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/5by5-radio/id553498407?mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=GfpxbBXXpXE-y3gfJGyOQcSr2tOpkzD12A&amp;uo=8&amp;at=11laDR">5by5 for Mac</a>. From there, you can decide to be notified when the show starts. As always, you can <a href="http://theeastwing.net/schedule">subscribe to the Google calendar</a> which tells you the time and guest.</p>

<h3 id="subscribing">Subscribing</h3>
<p>You won’t have to do a thing. I’ve redirected the feed to the new one on 5by5. If you’re not currently subscribed, and you’d like to, the new feed is <a href="feed://feeds.5by5.tv/eastwing">feeds.5by5.tv/eastwing</a></p>

<h3 id="thank-you">Thank You</h3>
<p>I’ll be recording a more in-depth state of the union for The East Wing later, but I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you for listening to the show, supporting the show by sharing it, reviewing it, and checking out the sponsors. It means a lot to me, and I hope you stick around for this new era of the show!</p>

        6th,

        </header><!-- /.post__header -->

        <div class="post__entry">
          <p>Back in June, I wrote <a href="http://ttimsmith.com/2013/06/a-new-rss-setup/">a post on my RSS consumption setup</a>. The setup has changed a little, so I wanted to write an updated version that I can point people to.</p>

<p>When I wrote the first post, there were a couple of apps and services that I was using. In case you don’t want to go read the previous post, the gist was that I was using <a href="https://feedwrangler.net/">Feed Wrangler</a> to power the backend, <a href="http://www.curioustimes.de/mrreader/">Mr. Reader</a> on the iPad, and <a href="http://readkitapp.com/">ReadKit</a> on the Mac.</p>

<p>Since this post, the backend hasn’t changed at all. I’m very happy with Feed Wrangler. David Smith has done a great job with it. He’s constantly working on it to make it better, and I believe only one outage in the six months of use. That’s pretty darn good.</p>

<p>Plus, the Smart Streams and Filters are great. I have all of my content filtered very well into separate folders, and as you’d assume, they sync across all the devices I use. I’m more than happy to pay $19/year for this.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="what-has-changed">What Has Changed</h2>
<p>I’m no longer using Mr. Reader or ReadKit. Mr. Reader became frustrating with time. I didn’t like a lot of the gestures, the sounds are a bit jarring, and the interface didn’t appeal to me. Thankfully, the icon was updated to something less creepy, but I decided to go another way.</p>

<p>I’m now using <a href="http://reederapp.com/ios">Reeder 2</a>. After moving away from it because updates weren’t ready for when Google Reader shut down, I’ve come back.</p>

<p>The new iPad app is gorgeous, using the native swipe gestures wonderfully, and elegantly. It’s one of my favorite apps on iOS, as the interface clearly follows the new guidelines, yet clearly exerts its own opinion on certain interface elements. The social and read later integration is great too.</p>

<p>I’ve also ditched ReadKit on the mac. I’ve said this previously, although I can’t remember where, that I don’t do much reading on my Mac. If I really want to read something, I usually save it in Pocket and then read on my iPad. Still, I decided to get ReadKit to manage RSS on the occasion that I needed it.</p>

<p>For me, it’s been a bit of a disappointment. It runs quite slow, and is buggy. However, I’ve heard a lot of people swear by it, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>That’s the new setup in a nutshell. If you’re barely starting with RSS, or getting back into it, I hope this helps.</p>

  <p>The increased prevalence of nondisparagement agreements is part of a corporate culture of risk management that would have us say nothing if we can’t say anything nice.

  <p>…there’s no sense in just listing the things that have transpired in a year without taking full account of why they were and are important. If you can’t determine what you’ve learned, whether good and bad, then you’re missing the chance to improve your life — and believe me, there isn’t much life to go around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love it when Paul writes. Hell, I love it when he writes, thinks, talks, whatever. He’s got a wisdom about him and a sincerity that is difficult to find. He talks about some of the things he’s learned this past year and also gives sound advice.</p>

  <p>One of the most common questions I’m asked about design is how to get the work you really want to do. Students often bring up the fact that they feel so far away from their dream projects. Even experienced agencies make excuses like “gotta make payroll” and “we’re too busy right now.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First off, I’m honored to be mentioned in this post. I like both of Dan’s suggestions, but especially the second one. Seemingly obvious advice, yet can have such a huge impact on the work you do.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the last four years I’ve had this daft rule: I don’t work with agencies.</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>Why was I doing this? I was really just attributing a few dodgy practices to all agencies—and minimizing my potential to work with great people. By a basic definition, an agency is just a collective that produces work for clients. If I worked with one more person, I could be an agency. Now I’m feeling a bit silly for discriminating for so long.</p>

<p>Great advice for independent contractors. Laura’s perspective has definitely changed the way I look at the issue.</p>

        <div class="post__entry">
          <p>It’s 2014. I can’t believe I’m writing that. It seems like yesterday that I published <a href="http://ttimsmith.com/2013/01/my-definition-of-success/">this post</a>.</p>

<p>2013 was an interesting year. It was riddled with both success and failure. Thankfully, the year ended on a high note. This was the first year that I accomplished all of my goals, except one.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>My goals for 2013 were:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Lose Weight</li>
  <li>Pay Attention to the Relationships that Matter</li>
  <li>Speak on Design</li>
  <li>Work Less</li>
  <li>Travel More</li>
</ol>

<p>This is quite an accomplishment! I spoke at two events last year: <a href="http://minnestar.org/minnebar/">MinneBar</a>, and <a href="http://www.blendconf.com/">Blend Conf</a>. I talked about the benefit of side projects, and people seemed to enjoy the talk. </p>

<p>In May, I quit my job at Rocket Lift, and decided to do Anythin’ Goes full-time. This has been really good for me. I’ve had the opportunity of working with some great clients, and the flexibility of managing my own schedule. I’ve also tried spending less time in front of my desk, and more time with family, friends, or other activities.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>This year, I travelled a little too. I went to New York City in the summer and the fall. I had the chance to walk Central Park the second time, which was absolutely beautiful, and the weather was perfect. I went to Charlotte, North Carolina to speak, and San Diego, California to visit my folks.</p>

<p>So what do I want to accomplish in 2014? Here are my goals for this year:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lose Weight</strong>   <br />
I know this is a repeat, but I seriously want to tackle this. I know things that are bad for me, but I don’t really know what I <em>should</em> be eating. I want to dedicate a bit more time into planning my menu every week, which I think will allow me to grocery shop effectively, and help me learn how to cook new dishes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Learn Rails</strong>   <br />
I know I can’t possibly learn Rails in one year, but I want to get very comfortable with it. At the moment, I can build a simple application with Rails, but I’d love to get into more complex things, and start implementing best practices like tests. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Collaborate with Friends</strong>   <br />
<a href="http://avclark.com/">Adam Clark</a> and I have been talking about working together on something for the longest time. I’d love to finally take a project where we can work on it together. I’d also love to work with other people. 2013 was full of projects that I worked on alone, I’d like to be in a position to assemble teams for projects this year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mentor a Student</strong>   <br />
Similar to <a href="http://laurakalbag.com/mentoring-a-project-the-idea/">Laura Kalbag</a>, I’d like to guide a student through a project. I’m at a point where I can teach someone how to manage a project, and I should do my part in paying that knowledge forward.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Take Work-cations</strong>   <br />
Running my own business allows me to work from anywhere. There is no need for me to work from my studio 80 percent of the year. I need to start taking advantage of the flexibility I have.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Those are my five goals for 2014. What do you want to accomplish?</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Didn’t lose weight. Damn. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p><a href="http://youtu.be/3BlHY69ZsZ0">So many activities</a>! <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

          <p>With a fresh year, comes a fresh design. I had some serious issues with the previous version’s typography, which I’ve mostly addressed with this redesign. It still needs refinement, but this is a good starting point for the year.</p>

          <p>Nick Cox writes an excellent article in the last <em>A List Apart</em> issue of the year. In <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/a-moment-to-breathe">“A Moment to Breathe”</a>, he tells the story of how he realized he was working too much, and what he <strong><em>forced himself</em></strong> to do, to correct it.</p>

<p>What I find so fascinating about stories like this, is that because we’re all so passionate about our work, it can be difficult to listen when our body is telling us we need a break. But story after story (Nick’s included), we see that the world won’t end if we step back, work less, and sleep eight hours.</p>

<p>I’m a huge fan of <a href="http://www.macbartender.com/">Bartender</a>. Because I normally prefer menu bar apps, things can get cluttered pretty easily, and as Stephen points out, there are some that you don’t need to monitor 24/7.</p>

          <p>What’s the point of an agile standup meeting? </p>

<p>Gone are the days of 30-minute status meetings where most people are half-asleep or pecking away on their laptops, oblivious to what’s being said. Agile standups are the leaner, more efficient cousin of status meetings where attendees actually stand up. On our feet, we’re more focused, attentive, and concise. It’s science!</p>

<p>Whether you need <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management?utm_source=bsa-syndicate&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_content=standup-meetings&amp;utm_campaign=agile-microsite#!standup-meeting">robust tools</a> for planning and tracking projects, communicating with coworkers, deploying products, or just some <a href="http://syndicateads.net/s/w3">general tips</a> on how to run an agile shop (and how to run them Rong?), Atlassian is here to offer you the tools and advice you need to get the most out of your agile practice. </p>

          <p>Ben Brooks on <em>The Brooks Review</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[A post on PandoDaily] blames the Newsstand icon and design on faltering sales. Perceived lack of attention from Apple, and lack of icon badging (I assume, because it is never explicitly said) were other ‘excuses’ mentioned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, fair point. The fact that you can completely hide Newsstand can’t be good for publishers. He goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have a lot of respect for people making a go of digital publishing like this, and for Fleishman specifically. BUT, it seems to me that if subscribers are dwindling and people are “forgetting” about your publication, then your problem is rather straightforward: content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. I’ve been very disappointed with the subscriptions I have in Newsstand. Blaming Apple is easy, and people just don’t “forget” about your publication.</p>
