  <p>The most conscious decision I made about openness was to not put up a front and not always try to make myself look better. We all do things that make us look stupid from time to time (I do it a lot!). But what’s really wrong with looking stupid? Why would I want to pretend to be superhuman? That would just set unrealistic expectations for my clients and everybody else around me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Laura is one of my favorite people. She’s real, she’s humble, and crazy talented. That combination of qualities have made her the success she is. In her column today, on <em>A List Apart</em>, she does a great job explaining why being open and transparent is a very good thing.</p>

<p>This is amazing. My only question is: why has this taken so long? It seems that this could’ve existed years ago. Good on Square for continuing to do great things.</p>

        <p>Dan Seifert from <em>The Verge</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Compared to the similarly priced Jambox, the Play:1 is considerably louder, crisper, and more present. The more expensive Big Jambox offers a wider range and better separation than a single Play:1 thanks to its larger speakers and configuration. But the Play:1 is still louder and sounds bigger, if slightly more muddled because of the lack of speaker separation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really excited about this news. Since receiving my new iPhone, I now need to replace by bathroom speaker because it uses the old 30-pin connector. I started thinking that it would be better to buy things that are connector-independent, this way, it’ll last me longer. </p>

<p>I’d looked at several speakers, and had heard very good things of all the Sonos speakers and <a href="https://jawbone.com/speakers/bigjambox">Big Jambox</a>, but was worried to go Sonos because of the high price point. This new speaker is more wallet friendly, and could be the start of a great relationship with the Sonos ecosystem. I’ll write some thoughts on the speaker once I receive and use it for a while.</p>

        <p>Jon Russell reporting for <em>The Next Web</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instagram announced earlier this month that it will begin serving in-feed advertising before the end of the year, and the Facebook-owned photo and video app has made a subtle, but important, change after it removed the option to switch off autoplay for videos on iOS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know what to say. Do I like that Instagram is about to be Facebook-ized? No. But, the fact of the matter is, that they weren’t profitable, and now they have to be. Is there a better way? Maybe. But what is it? I have no idea. </p>

<p>Here’s what I do know: I hate quotes like this, where Instagram says they want “these ads to be enjoyable and creative in much the same way you see engaging, high-quality ads when you flip through your favorite magazine.” Guess what? Everyone, <em>everyone</em>, flips right past them.</p>

<p>But, what are they supposed to do? If they offered some type of subscription, it wouldn’t make enough to sustain the business. If they <em>only</em> allowed paying customers, they’d loose their core user base of adolescents and young adults. They could offer filters as an in-app purchase, <a href="http://favd.net/">like Favd does</a>, but I have no idea whether that would make enough.</p>

<p>So, as much as it bothers me that they’ve gone the advertising route, I can’t help but empathize. I myself put ads on this site, and on my podcast. It’s easy, it often pays the bills, and sometimes more. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>What is Facebook without their continued unethical behavior involving privacy. And then to say “only a single-digit percentage of the nearly 1.2 billion people on its network” are using it? As <a href="https://twitter.com/tubes/status/388505400527450113">Sean Tubridy pointed out so well</a>, that’s “between 10 million and 90 million people.”</p>

<p>What Facebook seems to forget, is that what’s bad for users, is bad for business. A lesson they might learn the hard way.</p>

Also central to her reclassification is Microsoft’s commitment to Surface, despite previous claims from HP that Surface wasn’t a threat to its own Windows 8 tablet.</p>

<p>We all could see this coming. As Microsoft moves to create their own hardware, the companies that have built business around that not being the case, are now in trouble.

<p>Why they would make such a seemingly arbitrary rule, doesn’t make sense, and I’m sure will disappoint a lot of local businesses.</p>

<p>The question is: Will they enforce the policy?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People familiar with Apple’s plans tell <em>AllThingsD</em> that the company will hold its next invitation-only event on Tuesday, October 22. The focal point of the gathering will be the latest updates to the company’s iPad line, but the new Mac Pro and OS X Mavericks will likely get some stage time as well, I’m told.</p>

<p>I love Apple Event days. I never get anything else done.</p>

        <blockquote>
  <p>As the Web landscape grows increasingly complex, it’s increasingly important to demonstrate the myriad ways a Web experience can be interacted with. It’s impossible for designers working in static environments to realistically articulate every device, user setting, and variable that effects how a design is realized. Because of this, front-end developers need to work closely with other designers to ensure what’s being created is realistic and feasible. This requires rolling front-end development into the design workflow, rethinking our deliverables, and working together in order to create experiences that look and function beautifully on a whole host of screen sizes, form factors, and environments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well said. Brad excellently explains why I think the web is so exciting right now. Sure, there will always be people who don’t get it. But, the line between design and front-end development is being blurred, and I love that.</p>

        <p>Eric Schmidt is apparently quite the jokester. When told that some don’t find Android secure, Schmidt responded, “Not secure? It’s more secure than the iPhone.”</p>

<p>Good one, dude.</p>

  <p>I’ve looked at several tutorials over the years, but many were written with a certain assumption for the level of knowledge on the other end. Many can be a struggle for the beginner because you may not even have the tools to be able to use Sass. Because of this, I wanted to write a handful of tips on what helped me get on board.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’ve been on the fence about trying Sass, this is a really good place to start. I promise you, <em>I promise you</em>, you’ll never go back to normal CSS.</p>

        <blockquote>
  <p>This week, a Yale law professor took aim at Microsoft’s “<a href="http://www.bingiton.com/">Bing It On</a>” campaign…</p>

  <p>And <a href="http://islandia.law.yale.edu/ayres/BingItOn_Draft%209.pdf">Ayres’ results differed sharply</a> from Microsoft’s: “We found that, to the contrary of Microsoft’s claim, 53 percent of subjects preferred Google and 41 percent Bing (6 percent of results were “ties”). This is not even close to the advertised claim that people prefer Bing ‘nearly two-to-one.’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is fascinating. Microsoft responded to this professor, but in my opinion, gave a statement that were just words and didn’t explain why this test was so different from the one Microsoft conducted. </p>

<p>This is what happens when you make commercials that call out other brands. Making fun of other people is the low thing to do, and quite honestly, the easy thing to do. Tell us how Bing is <em>actually</em> better Microsoft, or shut up.</p>
