        <p class="screen-reader-hide"><small>by Tim Smith</small></p>

        <p>I had an absolute blast in Charlotte for Blend Conf, and I really hope I can make it next year.</p>

<p>First off, I just want to extend a thank you to Bermon Painter for putting on this amazing event. The fact he did it mostly by himself is admirable, and was a complete hit in its first year. Bermon was so kind to take a chance on me, and I’m so grateful, and honored to have spoken at the first Blend Conf. </p>

<p>The interesting thing about conferences is that when you hear about them, often times you hear about the speakers, the venue, the city, friends that are going, etc. Those are all great. However, the beauty lies in the things you have no idea about. The people you meet, the friends you make, and the conversations you have. For me, Blend Conference was definitely all of this. I’ve made great new friends, and I’m following new people who are just so insanely smart. </p>

<p>Two talks that really stood out for me were <a href="http://www.garthdb.com/">Garth’s</a> and <a href="http://wrenlanier.com/">Wren’s</a>. Garth talked about how designers can open source, and he’s in fact <a href="http://opensourcedesign.is/">created a site to begin this movement</a>. I realized during that talk that developers are more and more comfortable with sharing how things are accomplished, and putting tons of their source code on GitHub. At this point, it seemed so normal, I’d forgotten that designers don’t really do this.</p>

<p>We’re very protective of our designs and don’t like to reveal how the “sausage is made” per se. This happens for various reasons, but the biggest one is often thinking a particular solution is specific to a project. The artistic side of us loves to believe that our thoughts aren’t somehow reusable.</p>

<p>Wren also gave a great talk about designing on the z-axis. It blew my mind. That’s really all I can say. The way she explained the future of design got me really excited.</p>

<p>You’ll see both of these people on The East Wing soon, so stay tuned for that. If you weren’t able to make it to Blend Conf this year, I definitely recommend it. The atmosphere is just so nice, and Charlotte is a beautiful city.</p>

<p>Hope to see you next year!</p>

        <h1><a href="/2013/09/microsoft-acquiring-nokia-is-an-important-move">Microsoft Acquiring Nokia is an Important Move</a></h1>
        <p class="screen-reader-hide"><small>by Tim Smith</small></p>

        <p>Microsoft’s Nokia acquisition is more important than you think. It’s being brushed off by many in the media, and definitely by a lot of Apple fans; we love to ridicule this type of news. <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/09/03/why-i-think-the-7-2-billion-microsoft-nokia-deal-is-a-terrible-idea/">Some just downright think it’s a terrible idea</a>.</p>

<p>One thing is definitely true, the move is late. This acquisition would’ve interested a lot more people a couple of years ago. The mobile market is very competitive, Apple and Google have years of experience, and it seems Amazon wants a piece of the pie.</p>

<p>Microsoft and Nokia may be a joke in terms of market share<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, but them joining forces is important news. The fact that hardware and software are now being done semi-in-house is a big deal, and indicative of some type of vision which could be successful<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. Microsoft has noticed something very important, and I talked about this when I wrote about <a href="/2013/08/why-scott-forstall-should-be-microsofts-next-ceo/">Scott Forstall becoming CEO</a>—being responsible for the complete experience is the key to making products people want to use.</p>

<p>Since its inception, the company has allowed others to create the hardware for their software<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. They’ve given up control of the experience, and I feel it’s one of the biggest reasons they aren’t the company they want to be. Nokia becoming part of Microsoft begins to fix that.</p>

<p><strong>Microsoft doesn’t want to be <em>just</em> a software company.</strong></p>

<p>In Steve Ballmer’s letter to employees, he said, “We are committed to working with partners, helping them build great products and great businesses on our platform, and we believe this deal will increase our partner value proposition over time.” I predict that in 4 years, Microsoft will be exclusively making Windows Phone. It’ll be theirs; software and hardware.</p>

<p>One of the things that makes Apple so successful is the way they control the ecosystem. Lots of power users are turned away by how little control they have, but to the normal consumer, the careful curation of an ecosystem, makes the experience more enjoyable. It’s also important to note, that companies that don’t exercise this type of control <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/28/u-s-government-issues-warning-about-security-on-android-phones/">have lots of security problems</a>.</p>

<p>The next year and a half will tell whether Microsoft will take this opportunity, and execute well on it. They need a new phone, running a better operating system. If Microsoft is at all successful in the next 5 years, it will be in part because of this move.</p>

        <h1><a href="/2013/09/keyboard-maestro-macros-sharing-links">Keyboard Maestro Macros: Sharing Links</a></h1>
        <p class="screen-reader-hide"><small>by Tim Smith</small></p>

        <p>I’ve been using Keyboard Maestro for about two weeks, and I’ve enjoyed how much time it’s starting to save me.</p>

<p>Two new Keyboard Maestro Macros I’ve made are for sharing links. I often come across things on the web that I want to share and I have to copy the title, switch to Tweetbot, paste the tile, switch back to Chrome, copy the URL, switch back to Tweetbot, and paste the URL. This get’s irritating, so I created a Macro two copy these two values and put them on my clipboard.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2013/09/macro-1.png" alt="Tweet Sharing Macro" /></p>

<p>I believe Safari has built in sharing, but that still sucks because you have to click. This uses a keyboard shortcut.</p>

<p>Another thing I do often is copy links for show notes. For most podcasters, show notes are the worst part of doing the show. It’s difficult to get the link quick and save it somewhere. I personally envy the hosts on 5by5 that have a bookmarklet. However, I’ve solved this problem quite easily for me with another macro.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2013/09/macro-2.png" alt="Markdown Sharing Link" /></p>

<p>So easy! I press <code>Ctrl+Opt+M</code> and the link is in my clipboard formatted as Markdown. The time this saves me! I used to use a Chrome Extension, but again, I try to use the mouse as little as possible.</p>

<p>Hope these can save you some time. If you’ve never used <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a>, I recommend you look into it. Keyboard shortcuts FTW!</p>

  <p>It’s hard, if not impossible, to deny that performance is by far one of the most critical aspects of any decent web project, be it a small portfolio site, a mobile-first web app, right through to a full-scale ecommerce project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an area I’ve been dabbling into more recently. As a wanna-be front-end developer, I’ve tried to do more research into how I can do my job better, and make the sites I create faster. </p>

<p>This article is quite the extensive guide on various things you could do to make your sites faster. The obvious ones are things like minimizing http requests, and minifying files. Yet, one technique I hadn’t heard of before was using <code>rel="dns-prefetch"</code>. On this site, I put this in the head:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="html"><span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">&quot;dns-prefetch&quot;</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;//engine.carbonads.com&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">&quot;dns-prefetch&quot;</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;//static.carbonads.com&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">&quot;dns-prefetch&quot;</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;//use.typekit.net&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Essentially this does exactly what you think it would do. You can prefetch a hostname’s DNS with the code above. This is helpful when you need assets from an external source.</p>

<p>If you’re building sites of any kind, check out the article, very helpful.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Netflix get’s it. If I had the money, I’d buy Netflix stock, because they’ve done nothing but make great decisions in the past year. To think, there was a time when Netflix looked like it would go down in flames, and now is a producer of quality content at an <strong>affordable</strong> price. That’s a difficult thing to do.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to see what’s in store for the company in the next year. I see very good things.</p>

        <p>Next week, I’ll be flying to Charlotte, North Carolina, to give my second-ever conference talk. That I’m nervous would be an understatement. But, I’m very passionate about the topic,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and can’t wait to talk about it. </p>

<p>I want to take a moment to thank <a href="http://bermonpainter.com/">Bermon Painter</a> and Blend Conf. He invited me to speak even before I had <a href="/2013/05/become-a-better-designer-with-side-projects/">proof that I could speak</a> at a venue. I really appreciate that. Not to mention, Blend Conf has been our primary sponsor since July, and I’m very grateful for that as well. Without Blend Conf, we could not have kept doing the show.</p>

<p>For those of you going, please <a href="https://twitter.com/ttimsmith">get in touch</a>! We should grab lunch, dinner, or something. It’ll be lots of fun. If by any chance you’ve been waiting to get a ticket, do it now! I believe there are only 20 tickets left, and remember you can use <code>timsentme</code> for 20% off. If you can’t make it, Bermon has an <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-us-record-40-amazing-sessions-at-blend-conference">Indiegogo Campaign</a> to get all the sessions recorded. Then you can watch them from your couch. How cool is that?</p>

<p>Hope to see you next week! </p>
