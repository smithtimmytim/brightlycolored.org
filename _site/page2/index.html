          <p>Over a month ago, I published my very own Patreon page. Patreon allows me to continue working on the content that I love to produce, while giving readers and listeners the opportunity to directly support me.</p>

<p>As you most likely know, I would love to do podcasting and writing full-time. I know that’s just not a realistic goal quite yet. However, as a reader or listener, you can still help me pay some bills, upgrade software, and even have the flexibility to create more shows.</p>

<p>If you’d like more information, how you can help, and what you get in return, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ttimsmith">visit the Patreon page</a>. If you have further questions, don’t hesitate to <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#116;&#105;&#109;&#064;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#098;&#111;&#108;&#100;&#114;&#101;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#046;&#110;&#101;&#116;">email me</a>.</p>

<p>If you’ve been on the fence about supporting me, or this is the first time you hear about it, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ttimsmith">please consider becoming a patron</a>. I would greatly appreciate it!</p>

          <p>This week, I throw caution to the wind with Liz Andrade. We talk honestly about freelancing and running your own business. These days, it seems that everyone wants to sell you a course on how easy it is to work for yourself and make a lot of money. Sorry to burst your bubble, but it’s a lie.</p>

<p>Take a listen and learn something that might actually be of help to you.</p>

  <p>What really makes the AeroPress such a great coffee maker is just how versatile it is. There are a lot of ways you can use it.</p>

  <p>For my cupboardfull of aforementioned coffee brewing contraptions, each one has only one best way to brew coffee. The AeroPress has at least three different ways to brew coffee: espresso-like, pourover-esque, and french press-ish. Each way is completely legitimate and delicious.</p>

        <div class="post__entry">
          <p>I just saw <a href="https://upthemes.com/blog/2014/11/medium-to-wordpress/">this post on UpThemes</a> about migrating your content from Medium to WordPress. Now, I know that they’re just trying to sell their themes, but their comprehension of why people write on Medium is completely wrong.</p>

<p>Before I get into why they’re fundamentally wrong,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I’ll go ahead and say that their reasons why you might not want to be publishing on Medium, are sound. I’m all for owning your content. However, they’re also telling you that you can have everything you have on Medium with WordPress, which is a lie.</p>

<p>People don’t write on Medium just because the reading experience is beautiful; the writing experience is too. WordPress continues to descend into more and more clutter, making writing with it cumbersome and a burden. Sites like Medium give the writer the ability to focus on writing and publishing, whereas WordPress does not.</p>

<p>Personally, it’s the biggest reason I moved over to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Yet the average person doesn’t know how to create a Jekyll site, much less get it on to a server. You could go with something like <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, but then you need to know Node.js.</p>

<p>If your goal is to write, have a great reading and writing experience, own your content, and get your site setup quickly, you solution is definitely not WordPress. In fact, you’re attached to another object by an inclined plane, wrapped helically around an axis,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> because it doesn’t exist.</p>

  <p>Look and feel are important to me when writing. Ulysses and iA Writer both do this well. But I must admit I like that Ulysses allows me to organize my writing, as well as write. Where iA Writer has to be used in tandem with Finder, Ulysses works on its own.</p>

  <p>Scrivener has long been the tool that people recommend for writing long content on the Mac. We’re talking novel length work. But seeing as Scrivener is a bit odd in terms of UI and seems to be updated infrequently, I can see Ulysses challenging in this arena. Ulysses nails the Markdown experience and gives a very solid document management toolset as well.</p>

<p>Interesting non-review—according to Chris—of Ulysses. Seems there’s a healthy amount of apps in this space for everyone’s taste.</p>

His approach is snobby-ness free,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and gives excellent recommendations if you’re interested in making a better cup of joe. As he explains, making great coffee doesn’t have to be expensive, and can be made from the comfort of your home.</p>

          <p><a href="http://usewhiskey.com/">Whiskey</a> is a new Markdown editor that Sam has been working on. I got in on the beta quite early because I love his work. Whiskey is looking to be an awesome app, and Sam has been updating almost daily recently.</p>

<p>The app is great for many reasons, but the most important is this: you can tell it’s been designed and built by someone who writes a lot of Markdown. It makes a difference.</p>

<p>However, his post reminds me that I have to get better at sending him feedback. I don’t want to be one of those douchebags that just brags about being invited to betas without actually helping out.</p>

          <p>Steven Aquino for <em>MacStories</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The second problem with Apple’s implementation of third-party keyboards is they don’t have all the bells and whistles that the system keyboard does. To wit: no access to dictation or autocorrect; neither do they have access to the tap-and-hold-the-globe-button gesture to switch between keyboards. As well, switching from a light to dark keyboard for day/night, and using the <code>UIKit</code> blur effect is also disallowed by Apple.</p>

  <p>All in all, the limitations that Apple imposes on developers rolling their own keyboards make them less attractive to customers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fascinating article. I hope Apple loosens its grip on the keyboards. Till then, developers can’t make the experience users truly want.</p>

          <p>Khoi Vinh on <em>Subtraction.com</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s now more than ten days after they went on sale, and yet there have been no sales figure announcements, no bragging about new record-breaking numbers of iPads pre-ordered, no new milestones in adoption reached. There’s just silence. In and of itself that might not be remarkable, but the lack of news around sales numbers seems especially suspicious given that iPad sales have declined now for three quarters in a row.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This goes to show how behind I am. I had no idea that the iPad was in decline. It wasn’t until after I read the article that I realized that not much has been done for the iPad in its most recent iterations.</p>

<p>The iPad has become a vital device for me, and many of my friends—not all in tech—feel the same. Yet for the iPad to thrive, it needs more of a commitment from Apple. Khoi says it best:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What will it take to get there? The short answer is a new commitment from Apple to this product line, and a willingness to reexamine the company’s entire approach to date.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope Apple does the right thing. </p>

<p>What a great interview. Jon talks about his new film, the news, and the legacy of <em>The Daily Show</em>.</p>

I’ve only had it three days, which isn’t enough time to write a thorough review, but just enough time for me to tell you that I love it.</p>

<p>I received the case on Friday. I put it on and almost immediately fell in love with it. It’s light, and is thin enough to look great on the phone, but not to the point where you feel like nothing is being protected. The material is a perfect balance of soft yet firm. The case gives you more grip on the phone without being a nuisance to put in or take out of pockets. </p>

<p>Again, I’ve said before that I hate cases, but this case came to change everything. My first impressions are very good, and I see myself using this case in the long term. If you have hesitated at all to buy this case and had some of the same issues I did, hesitate no more. Keep on the lookout for a more in-depth review in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Cory Doctorow reporting for <em>Boing Boing</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shoshana B Roberts spent 10 hours walking the streets of New York with a hidden camera crew, documenting over 100 catcalls (plus countless less-visible forms of harassment), as part of a campaign from Hollaback, who work to fight street harassment of women.</p>

  <p>Within a day, she had over a million views – and a totally predictable passel of rape-threats from creeps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is sad. The ensuing rape threats are not only utterly disgusting, they further prove the necessity for awareness on street harassment. Cat calling is not a compliment. The never ending focus on the female appearance is a problem that transcends our industry, and each of us can do our part in being respectful.</p>
