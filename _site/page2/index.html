<blockquote>
  <p>Twitter is testing a new website design, which opts for a lighter, flat design that seems at least partly inspired by its shift to similar design trends on mobile.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This looks terrible. It lacks the polish it should have. The type continues to feel tight, and the fact that they’re going “flat”, is disappointing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.executionists.com/blog/website-design/cost-to-build-websites-2013/">According to recent research</a>, the average small business owner can expect to pay somewhere between $100 and $200 for stock images for their website. Of course, for the owner going through a professional designer, this is just part of a larger number. If you’re a designer, you should always be looking for ways to bring down the final cost of a website. Outbidding the competition isn’t the only factor when it comes to success, but cutting costs where possible certainly won’t hurt. </p>

<p>If you’ve been looking for a way to bring down your stock image costs and increase your bottom line, a new website may be able to help. It’s called Lootback.com, and it functions as a stock image search engine. The site partners with some of the biggest names in the stock photo industry, including iStock, ShutterStock, Graphicriver, Themeforest, and more. The premise is simple: they get a commission on every photo you buy through their site and then split that commission with you. </p>

<p><a href="http://syndicateads.net/s/uj">Lootback</a> provides users with a compilation image search engine. You type in whichever keywords fit your needs and it will come back with results from their industry partners. Helpfully, once you’ve created an account, Lootback will tell you right away how much you will save on a particular image once you’ve clicked on it. Rebates are paid into your account within 12 hours. That said, Lootback only pays out 4 times a year, so don’t expect cash back right away. Still, if you’re a designer who buys hundreds of images a year, the savings could prove substantial.</p>

<p>There are a lot of websites out there that promise to save the average shopper some money, but very few are dedicated to helping out web designers. Lootback aims to save designers time and money and they do a pretty good job of it. If you’ve been in search of a way to bring down your costs, <a href="http://syndicateads.net/s/uj">Lootback</a> is a good place to start.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today was always going to be a momentous day for BlackBerry, with a looming deadline for its proposed takeover deal with Fairfax Financial Holdings. As it turns out, the full takeover isn’t taking place, but the company is going to receive an investment of $1 billion from Fairfax and a group of other institutional investors as it seeks to steer a new course.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What? I mean, it’s tough to feel bad for a company that just received a billion dollars, but what are they doing? BlackBerry is holding on for dear life, and I have to wonder whether this can turn things around for them. I hope for the best.</p>

  <p>Twitter is strong in Japan (as <a href="http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2011/02/02/why-twitter-outguns-facebook-in-japan/">we noted back in 2011</a>) where it’s used by one-third of the Internet population — but the country accounts for under 10 percent of its global revenue and one ad exec told WSJ that many Japanese brands “don’t think Twitter is something to pay money for.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This particular post is interesting to me. Twitter is facing challenges <em>everywhere</em>. Why is it news that advertisers don’t want to pay in these specific places?</p>

<p>With that said, I really do admire these new ways of generating revenue that they’re trying. Partnering with TV, although I originally didn’t understand it, makes a lot of sense, and is one alternative to the advertising route that so many seem to just default to.</p>

<p>This is an interesting read. Although <em>The Bold Report</em> isn’t incredibly popular yet, I’ve always tried to hold myself to the rules of proper journalism. I <strong><em>do not</em></strong> want to contribute to the assumption that online writers are an unprofessional bunch.</p>

<p>Wow. 2.9 million was already a huge number, but now thirty-eight million? I’m keeping a close watch on my card to see if it’s being used, and I’d recommend you do the same. Also, if you were using the same password in multiple places, it might be a good time to look into 1Password. At this point, the probability of your information <em>not</em> being involved in this attack is low.</p>

<p>I couldn’t agree more. Although this product might have been created with great intentions, I can easily see it being abused. If people work for you, ask them to update you. Don’t spy on them, even if under the guise of “avoiding shoulder taps.”</p>

        <p>Jim Dalrymple on <em>The Loop</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple on Monday reported its fourth quarter results, posting revenue of $37.5 billion and a profit of $7.5 billion. This compares to revenue of $36 billion and net profit of $8.2 billion in the year-ago quarter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love Apple, but the amount of success they have is sickening at times. This is a stupid amount of money.</p>

  <p>Something felt a bit off about this week’s Apple event.</p>

  <p>Part of it was the lack of surprises, which isn’t Apple’s fault. All of the product upgrades, while nice, were incremental and predictable. None of the pricing was a surprise. In fact, the only unexpected product announcement is the zombie iPad 2 sticking around for another year, shamelessly at the same price as last year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree. It felt weird, and ended abruptly.</p>

        <p>While I admire all the hard work that went in creating this new version of Tweetbot, I can’t help be a little disappointed. The app has lost much of its personality; both visually and sonically. The new app has some very well done animations, but unfortunately looks too “default iOS 7” for my taste. </p>

<p>However, I did purchase because I respect the work of Tapbots very much and I want to support them. They have the reputation of making incredible things, and I look forward to seeing the betterment of Tweetbot.</p>

        <p>Rachel Andrew writing on <em>A List Apart</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Almost every conference’s second day opens with attendees being asked how their hangovers are. Second day early-slot speakers joke that no one will turn up anyway, or they’ll all just be staring into their coffee. It has become normal, in fact expected, that drinking and staying out late is what we do while at conferences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Rachel brings up a very real issue with our conferences and events. Because our industry is very friendly, and social, it seems we might be blurring the lines of professional time and social time, a bit too much. She goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re also underlining that our events are for over-18s, maybe even over-21s, by holding them in licensed premises. Most of us know students or even those who are working professionally in our field long before they are “adult.” Should they be excluded?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy having drinks—and the article isn’t advocating for the banishment of alcohol—but I remember being the seventeen year-old kid that couldn’t drink. I’ve always been very extroverted, so it never stopped me from talking to people. However, I can see how it could affect others; making them feel excluded and not part of the group, and Rachel’s article does a great job of shining light on that fact.</p>

        <p>Aaron Souppouris reporting for <em>The Verge</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After being caught paying for false praise and negative comments about competitors, Samsung has been fined just over $340,000. The issue first arose internationally in April, when Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission (FTC) announced it was opening an investigation into the allegations. That investigation found the allegations were true: the FTC says Samsung used a “large number of hired writers and designated employees” to post in Taiwanese forums.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Embarrassing. But wait! There’s more!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While Samsung is by no means the first company to engage in astroturfing, it’s been caught in the act twice this year alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only are they engaging in unethical marketing practices—which hilariously enough has an official term—they’ve been caught doing it <em>twice</em> in the same year.</p>

<p>Get your stuff together, Samsung. You’re better than this.</p>

        <p>Frank Shaw on <em>The Official Microsoft Blog</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Surface and Surface 2 both include Office, the world’s most popular, most powerful productivity software for free and are priced below both the iPad 2 and iPad Air respectively. Making Apple’s decision to build the price of their less popular and less powerful iWork into their tablets not a very big (or very good) deal.</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>I think they, like others, are waking up to the fact that we’ve built a better solution for people everywhere, who are getting things done from anywhere, and who don’t have hard lines between their personal and professional lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Microsoft looks incredibly stupid for publishing this garbage.</p>

<p>Who cares that you made a device you think “is the most productive tablet you can buy today,” when it’s not selling? Eighty-one percent of tablet usage is on the iPad, and I highly doubt that the Surface has a significant share of the remaining nineteen percent.</p>

<p>Microsoft has so much untapped potential they could use for making great new products. Instead, they waste their time writing a post like this that claims they understand “how people work better than anyone else.” Talk is cheap, but the fact is this: while Microsoft was busy loosing $900 million on Surface tablets in Q3 2013, Apple sold 14.6 million iPads.</p>
