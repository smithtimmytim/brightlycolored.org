Kevin Lanagin writing for *The Daily Planet*:

Kelly Thompson does a spectacular job of writing in Jessica's voice. I'm so glad she's at the helm of this title. However, I wasn't to fond of this particular story arc. The characters involved weren't all the interesting by themselves, and unfortunately—as I feel with many Marvel books—the plot of the arc is setup in so many issues just to be resolved in a few panels. In fairness, that may not be Kelly's fault, but an editorial decision.

All that being said, I want more. If Kelly Thompson keeps writing this title, I'll keep reading it.
