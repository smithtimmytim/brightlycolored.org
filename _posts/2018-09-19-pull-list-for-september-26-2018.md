## What I read last week

- **Mr. & Mrs. X #3** - Love Kelly Thompson, but I'm just feeling Rogue and Gambit as characters. Dropping this title at the end of the arc.
- **Return of Wolverine #1** - Really disappointed with this issue. I understand there needs to be setup for the arc, but there was so much setup, that we didn't actually learn anything. I also wasn't a fan of the art. The inking is very heavy.
- **West Coast Avengers #2** - This series is one of my favorites right now. I love the humor, and the dynamics of the team. Kate Bishop is a great character, and her moments with Clint were well written and endearing.

**Favorite of the week:** West Coast Avengers #2

## Picking up this week

- **The Amazing Spider-Man #6** - New arc! I wasn't all that happy with how easy the last arc wrapped up, but Nick Spencer is overall doing an excellent job with this book. Sad to see Ryan Ottley won't be back on art till issue #11.
- **Jessica Jones #3**
- **X-Men: Red #8** - Seriously thinking of framing the cover of this issue. Laura looks badass. Tom Taylor keeps doing great with this title. I hope the other X-titles don't mess with this one.
