> Transmit iOS made about $35k in revenue in the last year, representing a minuscule fraction of our overall 2017 app revenue. That’s not enough to cover even a half-time developer working on the app. And the app needs full-time work — we’d love to be adding all of the new protocols we added in Transmit 5, as well as some dream features, but the low revenue would render that effort a guaranteed money-loser. Also, paid upgrades are still a matter of great debate and discomfort in the iOS universe, so the normally logical idea of a paid “Transmit 2 for iOS” would be unlikely to help. Finally, the new Files app in iOS 10 overlaps a lot of file-management functionality Transmit provides, and feels like a more natural place for that functionality. It all leads to one hecka murky situation.

This is very discouraging. It's a scary time to be a professional user of computer-like things. Despite what Apple wants us as users to do or think, despite Apple's shift away from focusing on the Mac for work (or at all) and focusing on things like the iPad Pro, the iPad is still not completely viable as a platform for getting certain types of work done. The loss of Transmit for iOS is just another straw on the back of the camel. There are things that I *need* to be able to do, that there is no alternative way of doing, that is not possible to do on a platform like iOS.
