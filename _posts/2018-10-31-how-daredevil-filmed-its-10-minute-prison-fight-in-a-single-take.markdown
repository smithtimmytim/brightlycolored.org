> “I got the script on the first day, and I came upon, like, page 11 or whatever it was, and it started to describe this amazing sequence,” he recalls. “I just kept reading it and it just kept yelling at me, This should be a oner. So I finished the script and I literally called Erik, the showrunner, and I was like, ‘Mate, I think we have an incredible chance here to do a fantastic oner.’”
