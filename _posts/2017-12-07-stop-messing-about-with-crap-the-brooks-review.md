Ben Brooks on *The Brooks Review*:

> I search for, and try to buy, the best of each item I use extensively because I don’t like to be annoyed by the things I use often. This is the deciding factor for me, but not all the factors. It’s a bit of a balancing act, deciding if and when to expand the budget on something to get an item which is better. Often, I’ll forgo buying something I want or need, and wait until I can buy the best of that item.

> There’s one thing none of us can get back, and that’s time, as cliché as that is. Time is not recoverable, and the time spent being annoyed by something is doubly wasteful as you both lose time *and* happiness.

Ben makes an excellent case here. I find myself in a similar situation. I don't like buying something cheap that I know isn't exactly what I'm looking for. I'd rather wait, save up the money, and buy exactly what my research has indicated to be the best. In fact, I'm going through this right now.

Kelly and I have been wanting to buy an adjustable bed base. I've done a lot of research on it and found the one to be the best for us. The stinkin' thing is over $1000 USD. There is a cheaper $400 adjustable base, but it doesn't have some of the features that I want. I figure why spend money twice on something we should only have to buy once?
