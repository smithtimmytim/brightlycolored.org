Abraham Riesman writing for *Vulture*:

> The comics industry owes a debt of gratitude to Fiona Staples. The artist joined up with famed writer Brian K. Vaughan in the early part of this decade to create one of the most effective gateway drugs for comics novices ever printed: the ongoing Image Comics series *Saga*.

A great comic book requires words and art to come together seamlessly to tell a story. If there was ever a perfect example of that, it's *Saga*. In volume nine, there are several back-to-back panels that are completely textless—but due to Fiona's spectacular art—no less expressive.
