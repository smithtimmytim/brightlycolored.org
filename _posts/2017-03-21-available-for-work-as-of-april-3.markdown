Hi Everyone!

Just wanted to let you know that I'll be taking on freelance work starting on April 3<sup>rd</sup>. I'm looking for small to medium sized projects. I love:

- Jekyll
- Frontend Development
- Style Guides/Design Systems
- Teaching Flexbox and CSS Grid

I have limited availability, so I can only take on a few projects. Go to [hire.ttimsmith.com](http://hire.ttimsmith.com/) to find out more. Can't wait to hear from you!

🖖🏽
