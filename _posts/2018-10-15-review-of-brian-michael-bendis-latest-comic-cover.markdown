Jesse Schedeen writing for *IGN*:

> Art has been the driving force with all of these new Jinxworld books so far, and Cover is no exception. Mack's pages offer a winning blend of minimalist crowd shots, lush watercolor paintings and detailed character portraits. The constantly shifting art style enhances the generally dreamy quality of the book, while also playing directly into the theme of identity.

A little late linking to this, but it's important nonetheless. The particular portion I decided to quote is very important, given that many didn't like the art. Like Jesse, I felt it complimented the story beautifully, even if in an "unconventional" manner.

The next part of this interesting new story hits shelves this Wednesday. It's on [my pull list this week](/2018/10/pull-list-for-october-17-2018/), you should add it to yours.
