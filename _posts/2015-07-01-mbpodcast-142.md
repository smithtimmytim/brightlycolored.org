> TJ and Joe are joined by Tim Smith to talk about Pixar’s latest film. They answer the question, can Pixar return to their former glory with a resounding YES! They also take a few minutes to celebrate the work of James Horner, talk about Robert Zemmeckis’ firm stance that there will be no ‘Back to the Future’ remakes, discuss the new ‘Supergirl’ TV show trailer, and talk about Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto signing on for a fourth ‘Star Trek’ film.

I'm a huge fan of The MovieByte Podcast, and I had an absolute blast chatting with these guys.
