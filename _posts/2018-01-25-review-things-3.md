I've never been a fan of todo apps. I just don't use them. People everywhere seem to swear by these things. There's much talk about the whole GTD mentality, and what app was the best for getting things done.

{% include toc.html %}

I came across Things years ago. I owned the first version of the app, but didn't end up using it all that much. Recently someone I know started using Things 3 and I was intrigued. I'd been using Trello to keep track of my ideas for articles on this site, video ideas, and jobs that I'd applied to. I have a love/hate relationship with Trello. I feel that parts of the app are very well designed, and others not so much.

After watching and reading some positive reviews, I decided to give Things 3 a try. Cultured Code offers a fifteen-day trial of the Mac app.

I was hooked. Things 3 is the first todo app that I actually use. I attribute it in part to the design, but also to where I am in life. These days, I feel I forget things a lot more and need to write down things I need to get done.

## First Impressions

- I'm delighted by how much of a facelift was given to the UI.
- Areas and Projects are exactly what I want from a to-do app.
- There is a wonderful satisfaction in looking at the Logbook and seeing all the things you've accomplished.

## Design

Cultured Code has hit it out of the park. The design of the Mac app, the iPad app, and the iPhone app are nothing less than superb. The Apple Watch app is excellent too, which I'll touch on a little bit later.

Gone are the days of the pale colors, and a design reminiscent of skeuomorphism. The new interface sports brightly-colored icons, revamped typography, and beautiful use of white space. While the aesthetic and experience is consistent across platforms, Cultured Code has done a wonderful job of tailoring each interface to get the most out of each operating system.

Cultured Code has achieved an incredible feat hear. These are four different apps it's made you believe are one. And in contrast to some where the functionality is drastically reduced on iOS, I could never touch my Mac again and still have all the same control of my to-dos.

## Organizing Tasks

Where most todo apps only allow you to create lists, Things 3 recognizes two types of lists: Projects and Areas. You can create tasks in both, but this type of organization has helped my workflow.

An area can be used to group projects and to-dos based on general responsibilities. For example, I have areas for work, side projects, personal, and family. Inside those areas I have projects for this site, my job search, etc.

Furthermore, you can organize tasks inside a project with headings. I often use headings to organize the type of tasks that need to be done. When Kelly and I went on a cruise recently, I used Things to organize my packing list. I had headings for my computer stuff, the clothes I need, and my camera gear. This is one of the first trips I've ever taken without that horrible sensation of forgetting something.

## Tags

Each person will have their own way of using tags, I tend to use mine for quick bits of information that I can see at a glance.

{% figure alignleft /uploads/2018/01/things-review-05.jpg "Tags can be a very powerful way of organizing your tasks." %}

For example, I tag jobs that I apply for as either "remote" or "onsite". This helps me keep track of what types of jobs I'm applying for. I also tag YouTube video ideas with the "category" the video fits into. It helps me plan the videos so I don't do too much of the same.

Overall, I like the implementation of tags. I do wish I could make certain tags limited to a particular project or area, but I understand that most people aren't using the tags in the way I am.

## Things Cloud

Any modern todo app needs some way to sync. Things does this via Things Cloud and doesn't offer any alternate way of syncing. Thankfully, [Cultured Code has a whole page explaining what this service is](https://culturedcode.com/things/cloud/) and how they've ensured its security.

{% figure alignright /uploads/2018/01/things-review-03.jpg "Things Cloud allows you to see all your tasks on any device." %}

In my experience, the syncing works flawlessly. The best type of syncing is the syncing you don't think about, and Things Cloud definitely achieves this. I tend to input tasks on iOS either via the app or share sheet, then organize those tasks on the Mac. Not once have I arrived at my Mac with tasks missing.

## Other Features You Should Know About

- **Quick Entry**  
Things 3 has this feature, but I don't really use it since I input tasks on iOS. As is customary, you can customize the keyboard shortcut for Quick Entry. I have mine set to the longest keyboard shortcut `⌃⌥⌘ + space`, which might add to the reasons I don't use it. My personal use aside, Quick Entry is incredibly powerful allowing you to enter almost all the same information you can in the app without moving your mouse.

- **Apple Watch App**  
Cultured Code was very smart in what they decided to include here. In essence, all you can do is dictate a new task and decided whether to put it in your Inbox or Today. After seeing many Watch apps try to do more and fail, this is exactly what I want and need.

- **Checklists**  
If you need to go further down the to-do-ception, Things 3 offers checklists inside of tasks. After you begin a checklist, you can hit `enter` to continue adding items. I appreciate Cultured Code for adding this type of deep granularity without it feeling cumbersome.

## Final Thoughts

At this moment, I'm convinced that Things 3 is the best to-do app. No matter what Apple-made operating system you're using, this app is delightful to use. If you, like me, are unsure of to-do apps, I encourage you to give Things 3 a try. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
