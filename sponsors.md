## Campaign Monitor
We talk about Campaign Monitor a lot on Goodstuff FM. But why is it that we prefer to use them, instead of another email company? It comes down to the quality of their product, and the amazing people that work on it. Not only has Campaign Monitor enabled us to create newsletters that are beautiful, but working with them is fun, and hearing about new features is always exciting. If you need to setup a newsletter for yourself—or more realistically, a client—Campaign Monitor is the way to go. Campaign Monitor features Canvas, an easy-to-use builder for creating beautiful email newsletters that look great everywhere, even on mobile devices. Thousands of their customers are using Canvas to totally re-invent what they send, so why not try creating a template for free at
