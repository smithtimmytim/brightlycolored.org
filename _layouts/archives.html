<p>This site, previously called <em>The Bold Report</em>, has been published since 2013. If you know the exact post youâ€™re looking for, I recommend you search. You can also browse the <a href="/topics/">Topics page</a> to find something that interests you. If not, here are some of my recommendations.</p>

{% for month in page.months %}
  <h2>{{ month | date:"%B" }} <small>{{ month | date:"%Y" }}</small></h2>
  <div class="archive-list">
  {% for post in page.posts_by_month[month] %}
    <h3><a href="{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a><small class="pubdate"><time datetime="{{ post.date | date_to_xmlschema }}">{{ post.date | date: "%a, %b %d, %Y" }}</time></small></h3>
  {% endfor %}
  </div>
{% endfor %}
