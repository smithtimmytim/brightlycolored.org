## What I read last week

- **The Amazing Spider-Man #7**  
I'm still loving this book! We haven't seen Spidey in his suit for two issues. Now, you would think that'd be a bad thing, but the character development on Boomerang has been fascinating to read. Especially in this issue.
- **The Last Space Race #1**  
Picked this up on a whim because Peter Calloway was writing it (he's worked on shows like *Legion*). I enjoyed the humor and as a fan of space exploration, I love the premise. This comic is definitely going on my pull list. 
- Spider-Geddon #1
- Catwoman #4
- X-23 #5

**Favorite of the week:** The Last Space Race #1
