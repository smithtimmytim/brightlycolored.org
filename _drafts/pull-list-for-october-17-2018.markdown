## What I read last week

- **The Amazing Spider-Man #7**  
I'm still loving this book! We haven't seen Spidey in his suit for two issues, and you would think that'd be a bad thing, but the character development on Boomerang has been fascinating to read. Especially in this issue. Nick Spencer keeps killing it with killer story and great humor.
- **The Last Space Race #1**  
Picked this up on a whim because Peter Calloway was writing it (he's worked on shows like *Legion*). I enjoyed the humor and as a fan of space exploration, I love the premise. This comic is definitely going on my pull list. 
- **Spider-Geddon #1**  
Not really feeling this. Didn't really like the humor or the story. Looks like this is mostly just me though, others seem to like it.
- **Catwoman #4**  
As usual, the art and colors of this book are nothing short of amazing. Also, the A cover is done with an awesome-looking foil. But the issue left me confused. I don't really understand how this issue contributes to the story arc.
- **X-23 #5**  
I'm sad to say the end of this arc was disappointing. In fact, the last two issues of the arc were disappointing. Mariko Tamaki's run felt like such a great continuation tone-wise, but the end of the arc feels like it lost its way. I'll be watching closely to decide whether I continue picking this up.

**Favorite of the week:** The Last Space Race #1
