# Heading One
I admit that I like that simplicity, but I'm starting to think it's a little too dreamy for all but the simplest of sites. The main issue: you just can't expect type that you set at one screen size to look just right by simply scaling it down entirely proportionally. Big type might get too big scaling up. Small type might get too small (a common one that gets me). Or even the reverse of either, where big type might not get small enough.

## Heading Two
I admit that I like that simplicity, but I'm starting to think it's a little too dreamy for all but the simplest of sites. The main issue: you just can't expect type that you set at one screen size to look just right by simply scaling it down entirely proportionally. Big type might get too big scaling up. Small type might get too small (a common one that gets me). Or even the reverse of either, where big type might not get small enough.

Some Ignored_multiple_underscore_italics here

A line of normal text with `inline code` and *italics*, **strong font**, and even some μ†ℱ ╋ℯ╳╋. Followed by lots of Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

- hello this is a list
- another list iteam
- hello, i am a list
	- What is going on here?
	- Hello, what's up here?

1. Just like old times
2. I can't believe they're doing this
	1. This is an indented list
	2. another item on this list

1. **Lose Weight**     
This stupid goal is on the list every year. But slowly, I'm making progress, and it needs to continue. I signed up for the gym in January,[^2] and thanks to my lovely fianceé, we've been going regularly.

2. **Learn a Javascript Framework**     
I'd like to eventually become a designer who's also a full-stack developer, and this is what I see as the next step in my development knowlege. There's a lot of talk about Angular, Backbone, Ember, etc., and I'd like to know what's going on here. I've heard you can create some really awesome applications with these, which is where I see my career heading as a whole.
