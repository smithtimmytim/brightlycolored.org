[Mark Hamill on Twitter reveals his idea for Boba Fett in the original trilogy](https://twitter.com/HamillHimself/status/1063349506073194496):

> I once suggested it to George as the only way we could top Vader being my father. I envisioned her as a double-agent working clandestinely for the Rebels.

[Now, Ben Pearson writing for */Film*](https://www.slashfilm.com/boba-fett-as-luke-skywalkers-mother/):

> Watch all of Boba Fett’s scenes from the original trilogy thinking about “him” as a woman disguising her voice. It adds a different level of intimacy to all of the conversations between Fett and Vader (who, remember, would be lovers in this scenario).
