Just listing first impressions:

- The new interface is slick, and obviously from the iOS version.
- Love the new Chrome extension, and that your cursor is immediately in the search input
- 1Password Mini brings what I need to the menubar. Love this. Hated to open the main app to enter credentials into app that weren't the browser.
