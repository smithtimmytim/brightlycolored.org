Satya Nadella really messed up this week. Colin Lecher reporting for *The Verge* gives more information:

> Addressing a group of mostly women at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, Nadella told the crowd, "Itâ€™s not really about asking for the raise, but knowing and having faith that the system will actually give you the right raises as you go along."

And the idiocy continues:

> "That's good karma. It will come back," Nadella said. "That's the kind of person that I want to trust, that I want to give more responsibility to."

Of course, because he's the CEO of Microsoft, Nadella issued an apology which in part included:

> Toward the end of the interview, Maria asked me what advice I would offer women who are not comfortable asking for pay raises. I answered that question completely wrong. Without a doubt I wholeheartedly support programs at Microsoft and in the industry that bring more women into technology and close the pay gap. I believe men and women should get equal pay for equal work.

This "apology" is crap, and really not an apology.[^1] The fact that he claims he "answered the question completely wrong" is a lie. This isn't a small mixup where you said the wrong word, or maybe had a phrase wrong. Don't be fooled, this is what he truly thinks. A belief which he had to back up on, when either he noticed that it didn't go over well with the crowd, or was told by one of his people of the fact.
 
Idiots like these try convince you that asking for what you're worth is greedy, and a show of bad character. This is terrible advice. If you believe you deserve a raise, ask.

[^1]: Yes, he should apologize. Not only was his answer wrong, but it contributes to the fact that women are being underpaid within the tech industry.
