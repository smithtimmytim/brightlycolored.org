## What I read last week

- **Man-Eaters #1** - After reading [this profile of Chelsea Cain](https://www.thedailybeast.com/chelsea-cain-returns-yeah-im-dead-to-marvel-trust-me), I became an instant fan. She just seems awesome. So I picked up this first issue and couldn't be more pleased. I thought the premise was funny and the book delivered. Looking forward to future issues.
- **The Amazing Spider-Man #6** - I'm glad we finally got some story about Boomerang. He was set up in like the first issue, and then we didn't hear or see anything about him for the rest of the arc. Loved seeing more of him and learning about "the bar with no name." Boy do <mark>I miss Ryan Ottley on art though.</mark>
- **The New World #1â€“3** - Tony, the resident comic expert at my local comic store recommended this title to me. The art inside is very *interesting*. I don't dislike it, but I'm not in love. The covers however, are gorgeous. The story is great too.
- **X-Men: Red #8** - Carmen Carnero did a great job with this issue. I loved the close ups of Jean Grey, you can see and feel the expression in her face. Tom Taylor of course keeps doing a great job with the story here. <mark>I really hope they don't end this book at issue #11.</mark>

**Favorite of the week:** Man-Eaters #1
