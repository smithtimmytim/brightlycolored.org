## What I read last week

- **Man-Eaters #1** - Picked this up because I'm a new fan of Chelsea Cain. Funny premise, but the issue definitely delivered. Solid first issue. Will be picking up going forward.
- **The Amazing Spider-Man #6** - Really enjoyed the story in this issue, but man I miss Ottley.
- **X-Men: Red #8** - Loved the art in this one. Colors were great too. I really hope they don't end this title at #11.
- **The New World #2 & #3** - The art is very interesting in this one. I don't dislike it though. Very different to what I've seen elsewhere. I like where this is going though.

**Favorite of the week:**
