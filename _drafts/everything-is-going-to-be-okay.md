There are some days that I really stress out. Which for me is quite a new concept. I'm not one to stress much. If you ask anyone who's known me for at least the past 4–5 years, they'll tell you I'm pretty carefree. But something happened—maybe I just grew up, but I think a lot more about what I'm doing, why I'm doing it, and how it's all going to work out, that I feel more stress than ever.

The truth is that it's important to think about things. But at what point to you take a step back and just realize that there's only so much you can think of something and that everything is going to be ok?
