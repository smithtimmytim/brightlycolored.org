Every Wednesday, new comic books hit the shelves with new stories to be engrossed in, and new art to be fascinated by. This is my weekly write-up where I share what comic books I read last week, and [my pull list](/topics/#pull-list) of comics for this week.

## What I read last week

{% include h-rating.html text="Fantastic Four #5" rating=4 level=3 %}

{% include h-rating.html text="Man-Eaters #4" url="https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/profile/smithtimmytim/reviews/985589/man-eaters-4" rating=4 %}

Creator-owned comics are my favorite. Issues like this are the reason why. The whole comic is formatted as a fake magazine, and I loved every moment. The jokes are well done, and the amount of work put in to make this look _just the right amount of real_ made me laugh.

**Favorite of the week:** Man-Eaters #4

## Picking up this week

- **Deadpool #8** - Skottie Young isn't doing the typical 4-6 issue arc, and I'm enjoying it a lot. It offers the opportunity for some pretty cool self-contained stories.
- **Star Wars: Age of Republic - Obi-Wan Kenobi #1** - I'm bummed these are all one-offs. I'd love a maxi-series on almost all of the characters they're doing an issue on.
