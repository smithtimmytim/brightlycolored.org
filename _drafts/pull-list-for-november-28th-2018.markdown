Every Wednesday, new comic books hit the shelves with new stories to be engrossed in, and new art to be fascinated by. This is my weekly write-up where I share what comic books I read last week, and [my pull list](/topics/#pull-list) of comics for this week.

## What I read last week

**Favorite of the week:**

## Picking up this week

- **The Amazing Spider-Man #11** - Last issue before we get Ryan Ottley back!! So excited. I still can't believe how much I've loved this series. Eleven issues in and I haven't had much (if anything) to complain about.
- **Daredevil #612** - Picking up this last arc of Soule's but going to wait till it's finished to read.
- **Fantastic Four #4** - For sure picking this up until the wedding and I'll decide from there. I loved the last issue so I'm hoping for more heartwarming moments. Not a big fan of Dan Slott though.
- **Man-Eaters #3** - I see a bunch of guys say, "oh I'm picking this up for my girlfriend, or wife, or whatever." No! I'm picking this up for me! Loving it.
- **The Warning #1** - Looks like an interesting read. I'm getting in the habit of giving number one's a shot.
