## What I read last week

- **Analog Vol. 1 Trade Paperback**  
Read this book in one sitting and loved it. <mark>Gerry Duggan writes some great dialogue and his commentary on the internet is spot on.</mark> Also, the paper this is printed on is beautiful and feels wonderful as you turn each page.
- **Dead Rabbit #1**  
I'll be honest, I bought this because I couldn't pass the cover up. It's so nice in fact, I framed it and hung it up on my wall. The story was good too (another one from Gerry Duggan), but I didn't connect enough with it to pull future issues.

**Favorite of the week:** Analog Vol. 1 Trade Paperback

## Picking up this week

- **The Amazing Spider-Man #7**
- **Catwoman #4**
- **X-23 #5**
