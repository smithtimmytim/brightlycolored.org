## What I read last week
- **Analog Vol. 1 Trade Paperback**  
Read this book in one sitting and loved it. Gerry Duggan writes some great dialogue and his commentary on the internet is spot on. Also, the paper this is printed on is beautiful and feels wonderful as you turn each page.

**Favorite of the week:**
