## What I read last week

- **Analog Vol. 1 Trade Paperback**  
Read this book in one sitting and loved it. Gerry Duggan writes some great dialogue and his commentary on the internet is spot on. Also, the paper this is printed on is beautiful and feels wonderful as you turn each page.
- **Dead Rabbit #1**  
I'll be honest, I bought this because I couldn't pass the cover up. It's so nice in fact, I framed it and hung it up on my wall. The story was good too (another one from Gerry Duggan), but I won't be adding it to my pull list.

**Favorite of the week:** Analog Vol. 1 Trade Paperback

## Picking up this week

- **The Amazing Spider-Man #7**
- **Catwoman #4**
- **X-23 #5**
