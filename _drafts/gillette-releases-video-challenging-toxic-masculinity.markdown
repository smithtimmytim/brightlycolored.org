In what Gillette is calling a short film, we see several common things men say. It's a fantastic video, which all men should take to heart. As boys, we're victims of toxic masculinity, and that creeps into our lives as adults. But as men, it's necessary to think twice about things we were taught and evaluate whether they're right. Most often, we find that they aren't. "Boys will be boys" turns out to be a terrible saying, because those same boys turn out to be the horrible men.

I agree with my friend [Chris Courtney](https://twitter.com/designhawg/status/1085399328275996673):

> Thanks to [@Gillette](https://twitter.com/Gillette) for producing a commercial the encourages us to be better men. For those who might take offense to my open support of their campaign, feel free to unfollow. As for me, I'll vote with my wallet next time I need razorblades and buy Gillette.
