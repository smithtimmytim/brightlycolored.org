There's a lot about *Aquaman* that wouldn't have ever been possible in the past. Creating a world of underwater people (and making it believable) is a filmmaking feat, but ultimately *Aquaman* left me underwhelmed.

The dialogue in much of this film feels unnatural and stiff. A movie like this requires a lot of exposition to explain the Atlantean mythos. Unfortunately, that's painfully obvious in many scenes. Instead of establishing the Atlantean people, their politics, and beliefs as serious stakes, the poorly written dialogue makes much of it feel straight out of a badly written children's book. What's sad is *Aquaman* is full of fantastic actors, all of which are capable of much better than their work in this film.

The score of the film is all over the place. Some moments have a beautiful sweeping orchestra, and others have jarring electronic music. Even more confusingly, some scenes are scored with songs that don't seem to mesh with the tone of the film. Even a Pitbull song makes an appearance, which made me wonder if we were in 2010 all over again.

The story is also bogged down by a big CGI monster fight, which involves thousands of creatures that you've been given zero reasons to care about. Unfortunately, this is a trap that many superhero films fall into, having huge action set pieces without any thought of how they contribute to the narrative.

It's not all bad though. The costumes are pretty great, and seeing Aquaman in his traditional comic book costume is a satisfying moment. Black Manta's costume (as ridiculous as it might seem to some) is straight out of the panels. This film also nailed the mechanics of being underwater. The hair flows with the movement of the water, and voices sound… well… like if you're underwater, but still being understandable.

The best storyline in the film is the one with Black Manta. The way it was setup, the motivations for hostility, and Arthur's realization of his mistake all do justice to this classic rivalry.

In the end, *Aquaman* is a disappointing film that doesn't do justice to the rich source material of the character. Regrettably, it'll leave most people thinking the character is just as lame as popular media has made him out to be.
