L.D. Nolan reporting for *CBR*:

> A new report indicates that Lucasfilm hopes *Star Wars: Episode IX* will put the franchise back on the right track after a disappointing box office haul for *Solo: A Star Wars Story*.

> *Solo* only earned a little over $392 million worldwide upon its release in May. The film is currently the least successful in the history of the *Star Wars* franchise and may have [lost Disney over $50 million](https://www.cbr.com/solo-star-wars-50-million-loss-disney/). Alden Ehrenreich, the actor who plays Solo in the film, is [signed on for three films with Disney](https://www.cbr.com/solo-alden-ehrenreich-three-movie-deal-lucasfilm/), which means he could still return to the role in some capacity in other spinoff films set during that time period. However, *Solo* itself is [unlikely to get a sequel](https://www.cbr.com/solo-sequel-unlikely/).

While *Solo* wasn't an exceptional film, it was *still good*. I enjoyed it a lot more than *Rogue One*. It's not fair to judge a film so harshly when the original directors left, and [Ron Howard proceeded to reshoot most of the film](https://www.cbr.com/han-solo-ron-howard-reshoots/).

I should add, assigning J.J. Abrams to put *Star Wars* back on the right track is a dissapointing strategy. For the life of me, I can't find the link of where I said it, but J.J. is the safe bet. And that's no disrespect to the spectacular job he did rebooting this favorite franchise of mine. But after Rian Johnson's wonderful and different *The Last Jedi*, I wanted more of that.

One thing is for sure, I don't envy Kathleen Kennedy's job. *Star Wars* fans are hard to please.
