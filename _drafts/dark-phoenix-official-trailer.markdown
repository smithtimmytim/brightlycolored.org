20th Century Fox's swang song is *Dark Phoenix*, the last X-Men movie they'll produce before the characters go back to Marvel Studios. *X-Men: Days of Future Past* is probably my favorite X-Men film of the ones made, and while I'll miss some of this cast (not you, Jennifer Lawrence), I'm so excited to get to MCU X-Men.

*Dark Phoenix* premiers on February 14, 2019.
