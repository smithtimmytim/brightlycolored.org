[Renaldo Matadeen writing for *CBR*](https://www.cbr.com/oscar-isaac-hard-words-xmen-apocalypse/):

> Isaac revealed the costume and makeup effects needed to play the villain on-screen led to an "excruciating" experience, which feels similar to Jennifer Lawrence's past complaints about getting into costume to play Mystique over four X-Men movies.

> “Apocalypse, that was excruciating, " he said to [GQ](https://video.gq.com/watch/iconic-characters-oscar-isaac-breaks-down-his-most-iconic-characters). "I didn't know when I said yes that that was what was going to be happening. That I was going to be encased in glue, latex and a 40-pound suit — that I had to wear a cooling mechanism at all times."

Funnily enough, I was just telling a friend of mine that *X-Men: Apocalypse* is the only Oscar Isaac performance I didn’t like. After reading this, I completely understand why: he was miserable.

Recreating Apocalypse’s look in a live-action film was always going to be difficult, but keeping Isaac away from the rest of the cast ended up showing in the performance.

Oh well, time to move on as Fox’s run of Marvel movies has come to a close.
