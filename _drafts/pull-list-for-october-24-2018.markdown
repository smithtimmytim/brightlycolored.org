## What I read last week

- **Cover #2**  
I'm loving this book! Brian Michael Bendis is setting up an intriguing story, and this particular issue's subtext has some scathing critique of our society. Once again, David Mack's art is nothing short of superb.
- **Daredevil #609**  
This is part one of "The Death of Daredevil". I've been wanting to get back into reading Daredevil so what better than his final arc. Phil Noto's art is spectacular as usual, but what I was most impressed by were the colors. I'm so used to Netflix *Daredevil* that these bright and beautiful colors were a nice change.
- **The New World #4**  
A bit confused as to what's going on here.
- **Shuri #1**  
Sadly, I didn't like this as much as I was hoping to. The writing was a bit boring (although the ending was intriguing), and the art on the inside was cartoonish and drawn as if for a comic geared towards children. The only positive thing I have to say is that the cover is spectacular with a crazy amount of detail and dazzling colors. 
- **Saga Vol. 8 Trade Paperback**

**Favorite of the week:** Cover #2

## Picking up this week

Not picking anything up this week, since I'm in London for the week. If there was ever a great reason to miss out on new comics, being in Europe is definitely up there.
