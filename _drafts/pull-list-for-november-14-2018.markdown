## What I read last week

- **Dead Rabbit #2**  
I know, I know.
- **Deadpool #6**  
Ever wonder what Deadpool would be like if he was depressed? Wonder no longer! Lots of cameos in this one, but wasn't really feeling it.
- **The Green Lantern #1**  
Ok, so what the hell just happened? I have no idea what is going on in this issue, which is strange for a #1. All the hype around this book twisted my arm into picking this up, but I don't think I'll be continuing.
- X-Men: Red #10

**Favorite of the week:** X-Men: Red #10

## Picking up this week

- The Amazing Spider-Man #9
- Catwoman #5
- Daredevil #611
- Oblivion Song #9
- Uncanny X-Men #1
