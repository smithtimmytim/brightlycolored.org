## What I read last week

- **Dead Rabbit #2**  
I know, I know. [There wasn't much good coming from me](/2018/10/dead-rabbit-number-1-review-aipt/) about this book's first issue. But, it's unfair to judge a book completely on one issue, and I was intrigued by the story. Unfortunately, I again wasn't very impressed after this second issue. However, the covers continue to be stellar.
- **Deadpool #6**  
Ever wonder what Deadpool would be like if he was depressed? Wonder no longer! Lots of cameos in this one, but wasn't really feeling it.
- **The Green Lantern #1**  
Ok, so what the hell just happened? I have no idea what is going on in this issue, which is strange for a #1. All the hype around this book twisted my arm into picking this up, but I don't think I'll be continuing.
- **X-Men: Red #10**  


**Favorite of the week:** X-Men: Red #10
