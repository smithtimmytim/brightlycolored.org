> So, what's it like telling a Spider-Man story for the first time? "Honestly, it's amazing (pun intended...eventually...after I noticed it)," says [Tom] Taylor.

> "With a lot of heroes, they're most heroic when they're in their suit and hide away their nature the rest of the time," explains the writer. "But Peter's humanity and kindness isn't ever hidden. He wants to do the right thing by everyone no matter whether he's on the ground or swinging through the sky. I've always loved when Peter Parker is at his most relatable. Sure, he's a guy who saves the world, but he's still struggling to pay his bills with his housemates. That's the heart of this series. We're going to tell some big stories here, and introduce an all-new hero, but it's all about the micro. This is Peter finding adventure in his apartment building, a few doors down."
