Last week, I bought a new MacBook Pro. Earlier this year, I started to feel it was time for an upgrade, but wanted to make a sensible and adult decision. I told myself I'd wait till the Fall, see what Apple had announced for the year, and then make a decision.

The Fall Apple events came and went, and none of the new announcements spoke to me necessarily. The Mac mini looked interesting but for the video editing I do, I'd need to plug in an eGPU, and I'm trying to simplify my life, not complicate it. The Apple store had a refurbished MacBook Pro with a bigger hard drive, faster processor, and more RAM. After talking to my wife, I bought it.

Getting a new machine always makes me ner-cited (nervous and excited). You get used to the way you’ve setup a machine—which depending how long you’ve had it—there’s no telling how many settings you’ve customized just right to your tastes.

All this makes me a lot less anxious these days. Ever since I started version controlling my `.dotfiles` on GitHub, and putting all my files in Dropbox, moving to a new machine is a lot simpler. Sure, it’ll still take you a few hours. I think this last time took about 3-4 hours, but it was mostly headache free.

If you’re curious about how to do it, I’ve written extensively on my process to setting up new machines. It could probably be automated even furthur, but it’s a pretty sweet setup.
