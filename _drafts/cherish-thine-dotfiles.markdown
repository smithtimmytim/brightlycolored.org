Last week, I bought a new MacBook Pro. Earlier this year, I started to feel it was time for an upgrade, but wanted to make a sensible and adult decision. I told myself I'd wait till the Fall, see what Apple had announced for the year, and then make a decision.

The Fall Apple events came and went, and none of the new announcements spoke to me necessarily. The Mac mini looked interesting but for the video editing I do, I'd need to plug in an eGPU, and I'm trying to simplify my life, not complicate it. The Apple store had a refurbished MacBook Pro with a bigger hard drive, faster processor, and more RAM. After talking to my wife, I bought it.

Getting a new machine always makes me ner-cited (nervous and excited).
