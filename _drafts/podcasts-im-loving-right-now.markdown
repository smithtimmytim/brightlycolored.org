- **Reply All** - Been listening to this podcast from the first episode. PJ and Alex have great chemistry, and I always love the stories Sruthi Pinnamaneni reports on.

- **Welcome to Macintosh** - Sure, there are many shows about Apple news, but *Welcome to Macintosh* focuses on the impact it's had on people. This is hands down the best produced show on Apple.

  - [#15: The Orchard](https://www.macintosh.fm/episodes/15)
- **Today Explained** - Keeps me informed on what's going on in the world.
- **Death, Sex & Money** - Love this show. Anna Sale has some amazing conversations with celebrities and "regular" people alike about things that are sometimes difficult to talk about. Turns out, us humans have a lot in common.
