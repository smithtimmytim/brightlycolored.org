One of the things I didn't like about the previous version of this site's design was how prominent the ad was on smaller screens. Instead, I wanted to place the ad after the first post on the homepage.

Thankfully, Jekyll (really Liquid) allows us to do this with the `forloop` object. There are lots of things you do with this, so read [the official documentation](https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid/objects/for-loops) if you want to learn more.
