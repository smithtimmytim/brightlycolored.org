Tryouts this week! Only the best comics will survive the chopping block! Here’s what I *actually* ended up picking up last week, and what I’m planning on getting this week.

## What I read last week

- **X-23 #2**
- **The Amazing Spider-Man #2**
- **Mr. & Mrs. X #1** - Decided to give this a try because I heard lots of buzz around the book. I ended up really liking it. Kelly Thompson did a great job with this first issue (those honeymoon panels were steamy!), and the ending left me very curious of what’ll happen next.

**Favorite of the week:**
