Something I've been thinking about a lot recently is documentation. And yes, I'm thinking a little bit about legacy â€”documenting our life, and the things we make. However, I also mean documenting our process.

There's a lot of mystery surrounding what we do, and I remember being a newcomer and feeling overwhelmed by everything it seemed that I needed to learn. This is where I think documentation can help us a lot. In fact, I know that if we keep record of what we do, it can help our own selves.
